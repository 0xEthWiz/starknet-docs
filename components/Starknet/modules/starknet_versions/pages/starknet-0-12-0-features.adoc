= Starknet v0.12.0

Starknet version 0.12.0 represents a significant milestone in the Starknet roadmap. It contains the following noteworthy changes to the network:

== Introduction of the Rust-based blockifier

The link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/blockifier[Rust-based Blockifier] is a crucial component of Starknet v0.12.0. It significantly improves throughput and latency by reducing block execution time.

Developed by link:https://starkware.co/[StarkWare] as an open-source project, the Rust-based Blockifier utilizes the Rust programming language to implement an optimized block processing mechanism.

This introduction marks a significant milestone in Starknet's development, as it involves transitioning to the Rust-based Blockifier from the previous python-based implementation. This shift leverages the performance and reliability advantages offered by Rust.

By implementing the Rust-based Blockifier, Starknet ensures reduced waiting times and improves transaction latency during everyday network conditions. Moreover, it establishes a foundation for future scalability and performance enhancements, allowing Starknet to handle increased traffic efficiently and reliably as the platform continues to grow.

== Introduction of the Rust-based Cairo VM

Developed by link:https://lambdaclass.com/[LambdaClass] using the Rust programming language, the Rust-based Cairo Virtual Machine (VM) provides an efficient and optimized environment for executing Cairo contracts within the Starknet ecosystem.

The VM's efficiency and optimization result in reduced contract execution times, higher throughput, lower latency and improved overall performance.

This advancement lays the groundwork for future scalability and reliability enhancements, enabling Starknet to handle increased usage and maintain its commitment to efficient contract execution.


== Introduction of Rust-based local state management using Papyrus
Papyrus, an open-source Rust implementation of a Starknet full node, revolutionizes local state management. It enhances performance and decentralization, paving the way for mass adoption of Starknet.

In the 0.12.0 release, Papyrus has been integrated into Starknet's infrastructure. With efficient and reliable local storage mechanisms, Papyrus surpasses previous implementations. It optimizes the Sequencer by utilizing a local database and a flat
key/value storage structure, eliminating the need for complex paths.

Papyrus strengthens the ecosystem, adding decentralization and redundancy. It enables communication and synchronization among nodes, improving efficiency and sync times.


== Fetch older blocks with the BlockHash Syscall
Starknet version 0.12.0 brings an exciting addition to the system with the introduction of the link:https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Contracts/system-calls-cairo1/#get_block_hash[Block Hash Syscall].

This new syscall enables contracts to retrieve the block hashes of older blocks, akin to the functionality provided by the blockhash in Solidity. By incorporating this feature, Starknet empowers developers to access past block information within a specified range, specifically from the current block-10 to the current block-1024.

The Block Hash Syscall in version 0.12.0 offers developers increased flexibility and functionality in retrieving historical block data, opening up possibilities for more advanced contract interactions and data analysis within the Starknet ecosystem.

== Other features
Starknet version 0.12.0 also contains the following changes:

* Added support version 2.0.0 of the Cairo compiler.
* Replace the `PENDING` status of transactions to `ACCEPTED_ON_L2`.
* Change HTTP error code from `500` to `400` on API errors.
