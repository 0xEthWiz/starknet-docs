# Upcoming Starknet versions


## Starknet Alpha v0.12.1

.Version details
[%collapsible%open]
====
*What to expect*

The focus of Starknet v0.12.1 is on improving the efficiency of the sequencer capacity. The proposed changes aim to address the issue of processing failed transactions and optimize the network's potential for valid transactions.

*Mempool Validation*

A validation stage will be added to the mempool to prevent invalid transactions from consuming valuable sequencer time. Only valid transactions will proceed further in the processing pipeline.

*Inclusion of Failed Transactions*

Failed transactions during the execution stage will be included in the block with the status "REVERTED" and the user will be charged for the consumed resources. This inclusion ensures transparency and allows developers to analyze the reasons for
transaction failures.

These enhancements will significantly improve the efficiency of the sequencer capacity and optimize the processing potential of Starknet for valid transactions.

*Volition mode*

By leveraging Volition mode, Starknet anticipates a dramatic reduction in the cost of data.

This reduction is expected to be achieved through two key factors: the implementation of Ethereum's EIP-4844 (Shard Blob Transaction) and the introduction of Volition itself. The specifics of Volition's design and developer interfaces will be shared soon, providing further details on how it will contribute to lowering transaction costs.

*Fee market for transactions*

Starknet plans to introduce a fee market in version 0.14.0.

This fee market will allow for an efficient allocation of Starknet's limited resources based on users' willingness to pay for a transaction, rather than simply following the order of transactions in line. By implementing a fee market, Starknet aims to provide a more predictable and seamless experience for users, even during periods of high network activity.

====

*Prove failed transactions*

Starknet Version 0.15.0 will enable better handling of failed transactions.

Notably, the utilization of Sierra for proving failed transactions. This addition ensures a more reliable and robust network experience by reducing the occurrence of failed transactions and enhancing the overall efficiency of transaction processing.

*Short & fixed block intervals*

The introduction of shorter and fixed block intervals aims to significantly improve the overall user experience on Starknet by reducing waiting times and enabling a more seamless and efficient transaction processing.
