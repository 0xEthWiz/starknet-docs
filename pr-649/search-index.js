You can learn more about Starknet Account Abstraction here. In this tutorial we will use the Starknet CLI (command line interface) to interact with Starknet. Setting the following environment variables will allow you to use the Starknet CLI to interact with a consistent set of configurations without having to pass them as arguments to each command: export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli export CAIRO_COMPILER_DIR=~/.cairo/target/release/ export CAIRO_COMPILER_ARGS=--add-pythonic-hints Unlike Ethereum, a Starknet account is represented by a deployed contract that defines the account’s logic. In this tutorial, we will use a slightly modified version of OpenZeppelin’s standard for EOA contract (at the moment, the signature is computed differently). Set the STARKNET_WALLET environment variable as follows: export STARKNET_WALLET=starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount Now that your environment variables are set, you can create a Starknet account. Run the following command to initialize an account: starknet new_account --account The output should resemble: Account address: 0x04e93e1fb507d23b398f0a09f5873d3a7769b0e7ed40dbbe8fe7a2e8ea831006 Public key: 0x07a328511fa8552cd61aaaa89076fe40c3566f4594f29324aa754d41d7c7c55e Move the appropriate amount of funds to the account, and then deploy the account by invoking the 'starknet deploy_account' command. NOTE: This is a modified version of the OpenZeppelin account contract. The signature is computed differently. In order to pay the fees required to deploy the account and execute transactions on Starknet, you need enough ETH in your Starknet account. You can acquire Starknet Goerli ETH in the following ways: Use the Starknet Faucet to get small amounts of ETH directly to the account you have just created. This should suffice for simple transactions. Use StarkGate – the Starknet L2 bridge, to transfer your existing Goerli L1 ETH to and from your Starknet account. In either case, ensure that the funding transaction reaches the \"PENDING\" status on Starknet before proceeding. You can check the status of a transaction using the Starkscan or Voyager block explorers for Starknet. You can estimate the fee required to deploy your account by running the following command. To account for fluctuations in fee prices, it is recommended to transfer more than the fee estimation value to ensure that your transaction is successful. starknet deploy_account --simulate --account= The output should resemble: The estimated fee is: 822400000000000 WEI (0.000822 ETH). Gas usage: 8224 Gas price: 100000000000 WEI Alternatively you can run the following command for a less verbose output: starknet deploy_account --estimate_fee --account= To deploy the account you initialized, now run the following command: starknet deploy_account --account= The output should resemble: Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000563 ETH (562652117844076 WEI). Sent deploy account contract transaction.

Follow the below steps in order to accomplish your goal! In order to interact with the Starknet main chain or any testnets, you’ll need an RPC provider. Please refer to Alchemy’s quickstart guide to start developing with Starknet APIs! The following commands must run every time you open a new terminal to interact with Starknet. Setting them saves you time when using the CLI within the same terminal session. # Use Starknet testnet export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli # Set the default wallet implementation to be used by the CLI export STARKNET_WALLET=starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount # Set the path to the cairo 1 compiler binary.

Starknet accounts are smart contracts. As such, creating one involves sending a transaction, and takes a bit longer than creating an EOA on other networks. You can learn more in the accounts section of the documentation. This process will involve three steps: Generating your account address locally Funding it Deploying it The Starknet account declared through the CLI are stored on your machine in folder ~/.starknet_accounts/. starknet new_account --account account_name Your terminal will return your account’s address. Account address: 0x00d9d851f600d539a9f7811de4d9613a6b3c2634f8c0386a305c03216bd67559 Public key: 0x0293d6625d860b9a37a0319d1e3c1eecc27685075cbeaae4ef29ed717d93c58b Move the appropriate amount of funds to the account, and then deploy the account by invoking the 'starknet deploy_account' command. NOTE: This is a modified version of the OpenZeppelin account contract. The signature is computed differently. Next step is to fund it. Use the faucet to get some funds and send them to the account Bridge funds using Starkgate However you chose to do it, please make sure that the funding transaction reaches the \"PENDING\" status before moving on. You can look for it on Starkscan or Voyager starknet deploy_account --account account_name Your sample output should look something like this: Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000568 ETH (568383605914463 WEI).

Before we get started, make sure that the below commands are working properly on your system. If they don’t, please check the Setting up your environment section. starknet --version starknet-compile --version You can now create a folder of your choice (in any location) where you would like to practice your Cairo skills . Inside the new folder, create a file name hello_starknet.cairo. Navigate to your home directory: cd ~/ Make a new directory named cairo_practice and navigate into the directory: mkdir cairo_practice && cd cairo_practice Create a new file called hello_starknet.cairo touch hello_starknet.cairo Copy and paste the following piece of code into your hello_starknet.cairo file: #[contract] mod HelloStarknet { use starknet::get_caller_address; use starknet::ContractAddress; #[event] fn Hello(from:ContractAddress, value:felt252) {} #[external] fn say_hello(message:felt252) { let caller=get_caller_address(); Hello(caller, message); } } Customize the above code by adding a new type of event. Find a name that is unique (this is important). Add the following code: #[event] fn My_Unique_Event_Name(from:ContractAddress, value:felt252) {} Compile the above Starknet contract using the following command: starknet-compile hello_starknet.cairo hello_starknet.json The above command should compile to produce a hello_starknet.json file in the same folder. On Starknet, the deployment process is in two steps: Declaring the class of your contract, or sending your contract’s code to the network Deploying a contract, or creating an instance of the code you previously declared Let’s start with declaring the above code. starknet declare --contract hello_starknet.json --account account_name The above command may fail if you are using code that has already been declared by someone else! Please make sure to add custom code to your contract to create a new contract class. You will see something like: Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000132 ETH (131904173791637 WEI). Declare transaction was sent.

Once this transaction has moved to \"PENDING\", you can deploy an instance of your contract. Using the above generated class hash, deploy the contract: starknet deploy --class_hash 0x8ceb9796d2809438d1e992b8ac17cfe83d0cf5944dbad948a370e0b5d5924f --account account_name If you run into any fee related issues, please add the flag --max_fee 100000000000000000 to your CLI commands to set an arbitrary high gas limit for your deploy transaction. You will see something like: Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000197 ETH (197273405375932 WEI). Invoke transaction for contract deployment was sent.

Once it has passed \"PENDING\", your contract has been successfully deployed! Wohooo! You have just deployed your first Cairo 1.0 contract on StarkNet! Congratulations. If you quickly browse through the above contract (hello_starknet.cairo), you can see the contract has a simple function: say_hello which we are going to learn to trigger. #[external] fn say_hello(message:felt252) { let caller=get_caller_address(); Hello(caller, message); } The syntax to invoke a function in your contract is: starknet invoke --function --address --account # Invoking our say_hello function starknet invoke --function say_hello --address 0x03a5cac216edec20350e1fd8369536fadebb20b83bfceb0c33aab0175574d35d --input 152 --account account_name You will see something like: Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000080 ETH (79590795788372 WEI).

Pathfinder requires python to support the starknet VM used to simulate starknet transactions and function calls. Previous versions of the VM only worked with python 3.8 or 3.9 which was a hassle because most operating systems no longer directly support it. The new version of the VM bundled with starknet v0.11 now requires python version 3.9 or 3.10. Several configuration options are now removed, after they were deprecated in pathfinder v0.4.1. Here is a migration guide: --testnet2: use --network testnet2 instead --integration: use --network integration instead --sequencer-url: use --network custom in combination with --feeder-gateway-url and gateway-url --config: use environment variables or env files as an alternative Hotfix for a bug introduced in the previous version v0.4.4, which prevented a new node from syncing on blocks near genesis. Added Newton FAQ links to readme Node fails to sync old blocks @SecurityQQ made their first contribution in #799 This minor release contains some nice performance improvements for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee as well as some minor bug fixes. Also included is a major new feature: storage proofs - big thanks @pscott for his hard work on this feature! This is available via the pathfinder_getProof method which is served from both the pathfinder and Starknet endpoints for convenience: /rpc/pathfinder/v0.1/pathfinder_getProof /rpc/v0.2/pathfinder_getProof The method is specified here. Its results can be used to formally verify what a contract’s storage values are without trusting the pathfinder node. This is achieved by validating the merkle-proof that pathfinder returns and confirming that it correctly matches the known Starknet state root. storage proofs via pathfinder_getProof by @pscott starknet_getEvents returns all events when from_block=\"latest\" v0.1 starknet_getStateUpdate does not contain nonces Improved performance for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee by caching classes Improved performance for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee by using Rust for hashing @pscott made their first contribution in #726 The primary purpose of this release is to properly support testnet2 after the Starknet v0.10.3 update. The v0.10.3 update changed the testnet2 chain ID which impacts transaction signatures which in turn meant that starknet_estimateFee would fail for any signed transaction. This release updates pathfinder to use the correct chain ID. Testnet2 and integration flags are ignored starknet_estimateFee uses wrong chain ID for testnet2 Updated to cairo-lang 0.10.3 Contains several bug fixes, mostly hotfixes for bugs introduced in v0.4.1. Document that --chain-id expects text as input Testnet2 and integration L1 addresses are swapped (bug introduced in v0.4.1) Proxy network setups can’t sync historical blocks (bug introduced in v0.4.1) ABI serialization for starknet_estimateFee for declare transactions Soft deprecation of some configuration options Support custom Starknet gateways Pathfinder RPC extensions at /rpc/pathfinder/ with pathfinder_version method starknet_events optimisations fix block timestamp in pending calls Custom Starknet gateway support This release introduces support for custom Starknets. You can select this network by setting --network custom and specifying the --gateway-url and --feeder-gateway-url options. Several configuration options have been soft deprecated. This means using them will continue to work as before (no breaking change), but they will emit a warning when used. They will be removed in a future version, so please migrate to the newer options. To re-emphasize: your current configuration setup will continue to work as is. --testnet2 and --integration have been deprecated in favor of --network testnet2 and --network integration. --sequencer-url has been deprecated in favor of --network custom along with --gateway-url, --feeder-gateway-url and --chain-id. In addition, you will need to rename your existing database file to custom.sqlite as this will be the expected filename for custom networks. --config has been deprecated and will not be supported in the future. The utility this provided was valuable. Unfortunately it is starting to severely hinder how fast we can implement configuration changes and we decided to remove it. We suggest using environment variables along with environment files to configure pathfinder in a similar fashion. The following configuration options are now marked as deprecated: --testnet2, --integration, --config, --sequencer-url Optimized starknet_events for queries with both a block range and a from address Block timestamps for pending in starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee were using the latest timestamp instead of the pending one. This meant contracts relying on accurate timestamps could sometimes fail unexpectedly. Custom Starknet support Pathfinder specific RPC extensions hosted at /rpc/pathfinder/v0.1. Currently, this only contains pathfinder_version which returns the pathfinder version of the node. This release contains a breaking change, and also adds support for Starknet v0.10.2. The changes themselves are quite simple, but please read through each section as there are some caveats which might impact you when you apply this update. This release changes the version of the RPC that is served at the root route, from v0.1 to v0.2 of the RPC specification. Version v0.1 is still available at the /rpc/v0.1/ endpoint. This is the only breaking change in this release. Here is a summary of what routes are currently available, and what’s changed: / serves v0.2 (changed from v0.1) /rpc/v0.1 serves v0.1 (no change) /rpc/v0.2 serves v0.2 (no change) If possible, we recommend that you use the version specific routes as this will prevent such breaking changes from impacting you. This release includes an update to the cairo-vm embedded in pathfinder in order to support the upcoming v0.10.2 Starknet release. This bundled vm is a pre-release and may therefore contain differences to the final version used once Starknet updates testnet and mainnet. We will of course issue a new release if / when there is a new vm. Since these changes are not yet live on testnet nor mainnet, this means upgrading to this release will cause deviations between what pathfinder outputs and what can be expected on the network. More specifically, starknet_estimateFee will compute different fees until the network has upgraded to Starknet v0.10.2. If you don’t need the RPC route changes, it may be pertinent to delay updating until closer to the v0.10.2 release dates on testnet and mainnet. The expected timeline for these upgrades is ~17/11 for testnets and ~24/11 for mainnet.","title":"Pathfinder versions","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"pathfinder_versions","url":"/documentation/starknet_versions/pathfinder_versions/","titles":[{"text":"v0.5.4 (latest)","hash":"v0_5_4_latest","id":1},{"text":"Added","hash":"added","id":2},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed","id":3},{"text":"v0.5.3","hash":"v0_5_3","id":4},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_2","id":5},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_2","id":6},{"text":"v0.5.2","hash":"v0_5_2","id":7},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_3","id":8},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_3","id":9},{"text":"v0.5.1","hash":"v0_5_1","id":10},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_4","id":11},{"text":"v0.5.0","hash":"v0_5_0","id":12},{"text":"Highlights","hash":"highlights","id":13},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_4","id":14},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed","id":15},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_5","id":16},{"text":"Removed","hash":"removed","id":17},{"text":"RPC API","hash":"rpc_api","id":18},{"text":"Python requirement","hash":"python_requirement","id":19},{"text":"Configuration changes","hash":"configuration_changes","id":20},{"text":"v0.4.5","hash":"v0_4_5","id":21},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_5","id":22},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_6","id":23},{"text":"New contributors","hash":"new_contributors","id":24},{"text":"v0.4.4","hash":"v0_4_4","id":25},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_6","id":26},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_7","id":27},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_2","id":28},{"text":"New contributors","hash":"new_contributors_2","id":29},{"text":"v0.4.3","hash":"v0_4_3","id":30},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_8","id":31},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_3","id":32},{"text":"v0.4.2","hash":"v0_4_2","id":33},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_7","id":34},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_9","id":35},{"text":"v0.4.1","hash":"v0_4_1","id":36},{"text":"Highlights","hash":"highlights_2","id":37},{"text":"Configuration option deprecation","hash":"configuration_option_deprecation","id":38},{"text":"Network selection","hash":"network_selection","id":39},{"text":"Gateway proxy","hash":"gateway_proxy","id":40},{"text":"Configuration file","hash":"configuration_file","id":41},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_4","id":42},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_10","id":43},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_8","id":44},{"text":"v0.4.0- (breaking release)","hash":"v0_4_0_breaking_release","id":45},{"text":"Default RPC version change","hash":"default_rpc_version_change","id":46},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.2 support","hash":"starknet_v0_10_2_support","id":47}]},"9":{"id":9,"text":"The focus of Starknet v0.12.1 is on improving the efficiency of the sequencer capacity.

To get the latest version updates delivered to you, please subscribe to our mailing list here. Within Starknet’s deployment pipeline there are separate and distinct networks that operate independently of each other for testing before deployment. The current version on each environment are listed within the table below: Environment Starknet version Cairo version Mainnet 0.11.2 1.1.0 Goerli Testnet 1 0.12.0 2.0.0 Goerli Testnet 2 0.12.0 2.0.0 Starknet v0.12.0 is live on both Testnets. Use the Rust blockifier and LambdaClass’s Cairo VM to accelerate the sequencer’s time to handle transactions. Support version 2.0.0 of the Cairo compiler. Replace the PENDING status of transactions to ACCEPTED_ON_L2 - once a transaction is in that status it means that it will be included in a block, this applies to transactions - blocks still have the PENDING status. Add an experimental get_block_hash syscall. Change HTTP error code from 500 to 400 on API errors. Starknet v0.11.2 is live on Mainnet. Upgrade Cairo 1.0 version to v1.0.0-rc0 (Cairo 1.0 activated on Starknet!) Starknet v0.11.1 is live on Mainnet. Upgrade Cairo 1.0 version to v1.0.0-rc0 (Currently disabled on Mainnet until version 0.11.2). Charged transaction fee is now based on an average Ethereum gas price instead of a single sample (estimation API is unaffected). API changes: Remove the state root in get_state_update for pending blocks to allow faster responses in future versions. Testing framework: Allow declaring (and interacting with) Cairo 1.0 contracts. Currently, the Cairo 1.0 ABI is not supported yet, so a Cairo 0 ABI should be supplied to declare() manually. Split deploy() to two phases declare and deploy: deprecated_declare() (for Cairo 0 contract) or declare() (for Cairo 1.0 contracts) and deploy() (for both). Add current block hash to the Starknet Core contract (currently not verified by the Starknet OS): Breaking change: The LogStateUpdate event’s data is changed to include blockHash. Starknet v0.11.0 is live on Mainnet. invoke and declare transactions of version 0 are no longer supported on this version. In Starknet v0.11.0, you can declare, deploy and run Cairo 1.0 smart contracts. We also introduce a new system call that allows a smooth transitioning of existing contracts to a Cairo 1.0 implementation. Historically, contract classes have been defined in terms of Cairo assembly, or Casm for short (the class definition also included more information needed for execution, e.g., hint data). The novelty of Cairo 1.0 is the introduction of Sierra (Safe Intermediate Representation), an intermediate layer between Cairo 1.0 and Casm. The introduction of Cairo 1.0 and Sierra has several effects on the system. Below we list the effects on each component; of particular note are: A new version of the declare transaction, which allows sending the new class structure The state commitment will now include contract classes Changes to the on-chain data format New system call - replace_class The deploy transaction is no longer supported on this version. Starknet Performance - Separate the state commitment computation from the execution of the transactions Add starknet-class-hash command to compute the class hash of a compiled Starknet contract Cairo: Autoformatter: Automatically break lines inside expressions This version introduces sequencer parallelization! This is the first step in our roadmap of performance upgrades. Details about the specific mechanism of parallelization and the roadmap in general are described in this medium post. A new endpoint, estimate_fee_bulk, is added to the feeder gateway. This will allow estimating the fee of several transactions at once, where each transaction is executed relative to the resulting state from applying the previous one. Sequencing performance improvements Builtin ratio changes, which affects builtin costs Add estimate_fee_bulk API that computes the fee of multiple transactions that will be executed consecutively As part of this version, we will also increase the finality of transactions in the pending block, by fixing the timestamp at the time of the block creation. This will solve the issue of transactions moving from pending to rejected on account of too old timestamp Starknet: Add DeployAccount transaction (which will replace the Deploy transaction for deploying account contracts). To use it, you should first add enough funds to your account address to pay the transaction fee, and then you can invoke DeployAccount Split the starknet deploy_account CLI command into starknet new_account and starknet deploy_account Account contracts that are expected to be deployed this way should implement the`validate_deploy()` entry point, which should check the signature of the DeployAccount transaction Improve L1 fee computation: the fee is computed according to the diff of the storage state API: Remove entry_point_type field from transaction information Cairo: Add uint256_mul_div_mod to uint256.cairo This version introduces the next step in Starknet’s account abstraction design, specifically the validate/execute separation. See here for more information. Starknet: Contract (breaking changes): @external and @view functions should be imported directly by the main compiled file. Otherwise, they will not be usable as external functions Forbid using the same storage variable name in two modules New transaction version (version 1) for invoke and declare transactions: Transactions of version 0 are deprecated and will not be supported in Starknet from the next version (v0.11.0). Please update your systems to use the new version In order to use transactions of version 1 you will need to upgrade your account contracts Add nonce field to the transactions. Nonce validation is now part of the Starknet protocol and is enforced to be executed sequentially Invoke: Split execute to two functions:` validate` (only validates the transaction) and execute (only executes the transaction) Remove the selector (which is now always execute) field, following the above change. Declare: declare transaction should now be sent from an account (and is validated using validate_declare in the account contract) Support fee for sending L1 messages. At this point, it’s not mandatory and messages with no fee will still be handled. Starting from the next version it will become mandatory. Cairo: Syntax changes in Cairo (to make it more similar to rust and C++): You can use the cairo-migrate script to convert old code to the new syntax. Use the -i flag to apply the changes to the files End statements with ; New lines are still part of the language at this point, and you cannot put more than one instruction per line. This will change in Cairo1.0. Use { … } for code blocks (instead of : and end) Add () around the condition of if statements Remove the member keyword in structs Change comment to use // instead of # Use …​, ap` instead of `...; ap in low level Cairo code Support return types that are not tuples. For example, func foo() → felt (instead of func foo() → (r: felt)) As a result, it’s now mandatory to specify return types. func foo() → (res) should be replaced by func foo() → (res: felt). The cairo-migrate tool does that automatically. Return statement accepts expressions, rather than only tuples. For example, you can write let x = (5,); return x; A few standard library functions were changed to return felt. The cairo-migrate script also fixes calls to those functions Support using functions as expressions This only applies to functions with → felt signature`, whose ap change is known at compile-time (e.g., recursive functions cannot be used this way) Fix a bug in the secp signature verification code that allowed a malicious prover to ignore the value of v (this does not let the prover fake a signature, but allows it to claim that a valid signature is invalid). Add Cairo code for the recursive STARK verifier Technical changes: * Move from python3.7 to python3.9 Starknet: API changes: Add get_block_traces API - returns all the transaction traces of a given block Add a list of declared contracts in get_state_update Add a 0x prefix for class hash in the API Add starknet_version field for blocks (only applies to new blocks) Starknet CLI: Change the default block number to pending Using a wallet is the default, --no_wallet must be specified explicitly to override this Deploying contracts: Add deploy_contract function to the account contract created by starknet deploy_account Use this function to deploy contract (unless using --no_wallet). In particular, deploy should be used after declaring the contract (it expects the contract class hash) Support --dry_run to get the transaction information without signing or sending it Support deploy_from_zero in the deploy syscall to deploy a contract to an address that does not depend on the deployer Cairo: * Support and in if statements (if x == y and z == w). At the moment other boolean combinations are not supported This version introduces the contract class/instance paradigm into Starknet. See here for more information. Starknet: Enforce fees - max_fee must not be set to zero, and selector must be execute Split the concepts of contract class and contract instance. Add declare transaction type New API and CLI commands: declare - Declares a contract class get_class_by_hash - Returns the contract class given its hash get_class_hash_at - Returns the class hash for a given contract instance address Rename delegate_call to library_call, and change the contract address argument to class hash. Add a deploy system call. Rename ContractDefinition to ContractClass Reduce the compiled contract file’s size by removing unnecessary identifiers (this optimization can be disabled using --dont_filter_identifiers) Cairo: Initial support for the EC-op builtin (scalar multiplication over the STARK curve). Not supported in Starknet yet. Add additional helper methods to blake2s.cairo, including big-endian support Technical changes: * Change function’s return type from a struct to a named tuple. In particular, foo.Return.SIZE is no longer supported.","title":"Version notes","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"version_notes","url":"/documentation/starknet_versions/version_notes/","titles":[{"text":"Starknet environments","hash":"starknet_environments","id":1},{"text":"Starknet v0.12.0 (July 4th, 23)","hash":"version0.12.0","id":2},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes","id":3},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.2 (May 31, 23)","hash":"version0.11.2","id":4},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_2","id":5},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.1 (May 23, 23)","hash":"version0.11.1","id":6},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_3","id":7},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.0 (Mar 29, 23)","hash":"version0.11.0","id":8},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_4","id":9},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.3 (Dec 12, 22)","hash":"version0.10.3","id":10},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_5","id":11},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.2 (Nov 29, 22)","hash":"version0.10.2","id":12},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_6","id":13},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.1 (Oct 25, 22)","hash":"version0.10.1","id":14},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_7","id":15},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.0 (Sept 05, 22)","hash":"version0.10.0","id":16},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_8","id":17},{"text":"Starknet v0.9.1 (July 20, 22)","hash":"version0.9.1","id":18},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_9","id":19},{"text":"Starknet v0.9.0 (June 06, 22)","hash":"version0.9.0","id":20},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_10","id":21}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"A list of recommended full-nodes & API providers.

Starknet’s account type is inspired by Ethereum’s EIP-4337, where instead of EOAs, you now use smart contract accounts with arbitrary verification logic. Through the use of smart contracts, you are provided with complete flexibility within your account implementation. While not mandatory at the protocol level, a richer standard interface for accounts was developed by the community. This standard was developed by OpenZeppelin, in a close collaboration with wallet teams and other Core Starknet developers. You can see the IAccount interface here. In Starknet, similar to Ethereum, every contract has a nonce. This nonce is sequential; when a transaction is sent from an account, its nonce must match the account’s nonce and it’s incremented after the transaction is executed (whether or not it was reverted). Note that, similar to Ethereum, only the nonce of account contracts (that is, those adhering to the above structure) can be non-zero. A nonce serves two important roles: It guarantees transaction hash uniqueness (this is important for good UX) It provides replay protection to the account (since the signature refers to a particular nonce, the transaction can’t be replayed by a malicious party) As seen above, Starknet currently determines the nonce structure (sequential) at the protocol level. In the future, Starknet will consider a more flexible design, extending account abstraction to nonce management (previously referred to as \"nonce abstraction\").","title":"Starknet account interface","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"approach","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/approach/","titles":[{"text":"Replay protection","hash":"replay_protection","id":1}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"Starknet provides the deploy_account transaction in order to deploy new accounts to the network. In order to deploy a new account on StarkNet you need to complete the following steps: Decide on the account contract that you want to deploy Compute your would-be account address off-chain Send funds to this address Once the address has enough funds to pay for the deployment, you can then send a deploy_account transaction. Upon receiving a deploy_account transaction, the sequencer will: Verify that the address has funds to pay for the deployment Execute the constructor with the given arguments Execute the __validate_deploy__ entry point (See below) Charge fee from the new account address Advance the nonce to 1 There are two potential issues that arise from sending a deploy_account transaction without any extra validation: Sequencers having the ability to charge arbitrarily high fees, thus potentially draining user funds from a pre-funded account A bad actor having the ability to carry out a sequencer DOS attack by sending multiple, invalid deploy_account transactions. This would result in the sequencer not being compensated for work completed. To prevent the scenario described in the first point, a new optional validation entrypoint is provided: __validate_deploy__. To prevent the potential DOS attack from the second point, we introduce some limitations on the constructor and _validate_deploy _ executions, namely: Limited # of Cairo steps Limited # of builtin applications No external contract calls (library calls and self-calls are allowed) This entrypoint should be included in any accounts or contracts that wish to allow this new deployment flow. __validate_deploy__ expects the following arguments: class hash contract address salt constructor arguments - the arguments expected by the contract’s constructor (this will be enforced in the compiler). In determining the contract address, deployer address 0 will be used. Consider an account with the following constructor signature: @constructor func constructor{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}( _public_key: felt ) Then the signature of __validate_deploy__ must be: func __validate_deploy__{ syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr, ecdsa_ptr: SignatureBuiltin* }(class_hash: felt, contract_address_salt: felt, _public_key: felt) The transaction hash and max_fee are accessible through the get_tx_info system call.","title":"Deploying new accounts","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"deploying_new_accounts","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/deploying_new_accounts/","titles":[{"text":"Deploy account transaction","hash":"deploy_account_transaction","id":1},{"text":"Transaction flow","hash":"transaction_flow","id":2},{"text":"Validate deploy","hash":"validate_deploy","id":3},{"text":"Using validate deploy","hash":"using_validate_deploy","id":4}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"An account is a user’s representation on-chain and the way of interacting with the blockchain. Through an account, you may send transactions and interact with other contracts. To \"own\" an on-chain asset (e.g. ERC20 token or an NFT), it has to be associated with your account address. Within Ethereum individual user accounts are known as Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). EOAs differ from smart contracts in that they are not controlled by code. An EOA is determined by a pair of private and public keys. The account’s address is derived from those keys and only by possessing the private key can you initiate transactions from an account. While Ethereum contracts are \"passive\", i.e., they can only change if they were called inside a transaction, EOAs can initiate transactions. While simple, EOAs have a major drawback – there’s no flexibility in the account behavior, i.e. the Ethereum protocol dictates what it means for a transaction initiated by an EOA to be valid (the signature scheme is fixed). In particular, control over the private key gives complete control over the account. Although this is theoretically a secure method of account management, in practice it has some drawbacks, such as requiring you to keep your seed phrase secure yet accessible to you and limited flexibility surrounding wallet functionality. EIP-4337, a design proposal for Ethereum outlines account abstraction whereby all accounts are managed via a dedicated smart contract on the Ethereum network, as a way to increase flexibility and usability. You can add custom logic on top of the basic EOA functionality, thereby bringing account abstraction into Ethereum. The idea behind account abstraction is to allow more flexibility in the management of accounts rather than have their behavior determined at the protocol level. This can be achieved by introducing account contracts - smart contracts with programmable logic that determines the user’s account. Using account abstraction you can now program how your account functions. For example, you can: Determine what it means for a signature to be valid or what contracts your account is allowed to interact with. This is known as \"signature abstraction\" Pay transaction fees in different tokens - this is sometimes known as \"fee abstraction\" Design your own replay protection mechanism and allow sending multiple uncoupled transactions in parallel. Compare this to the sequential nonce solution used in Ethereum, which results in transactions being inherently sequential, i.e., even if you want to send two transactions in parallel, you must wait for some confirmation on the first before sending the second. Otherwise, the second transaction may be rejected due to an invalid nonce. With account abstraction, one can discuss different solutions that bypass the need for a sequential nonce. This is known as \"nonce abstraction\" Today, Starknet offers signature abstraction. In the future, we will enrich the current account abstraction design (see e.g. the paymaster proposal for fee abstraction). Two examples of how you might program an account to function using account abstraction are: Social recovery A process where if you lose your wallet, you are able to retrieve it via a selected social network, vastly improving the typical experience of wallet recovery. Operating your account via facial recognition With signature abstraction, you can use your phone’s native hardware to sign transactions, making it practically impossible to take control of another user’s account (even in the case of the phone itself being stolen).","title":"What is an account?","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"introduction","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/introduction/","titles":[{"text":"Ethereum account structure","hash":"ethereum_account_structure","id":1},{"text":"What is Account Abstraction?","hash":"account_abstraction","id":2},{"text":"Examples of customizing account functionality","hash":"examples","id":3}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"The key stages of transaction lifetime are: The sequencer selects a transaction from the mempool and executes __validate__ If the transaction was valid, the __execute__ function is called If __execute__ ran successfully, the sequencer includes the transaction in the block, charges the fee and proceeds to work on the next transaction (once the block is concluded, it will be sent to the prover) The sequencer receives fees in ETH in return for including transactions in a block.

The __validate__ function ensures that any transaction submitted was indeed initiated by the account owner and therefore will not take up unjustified resources during the execution process. Without this mechanism, a forged transaction can result in the sequencer stealing the user’s funds. In short, __validate__ ensures that the sequencer may only include transactions that were approved by the account owner. The arbitrary logic allowed in the __validate__ function gives the account’s designer the ability to determine what it means for a transaction to be valid. This gives rise to the usage of different signature schemes and other exotic accounts. When the __validate__ function fails, no fee will be taken from the account in question. There are some limitations set on the __validate__ function. The purpose of these limitations is twofold: We want to avoid the sequencer having to do a lot of work only to discover that the validation failed and the sequencer is then not eligible to charge a fee (if this was possible, the sequencer would be completely exposed to DOS attacks). Validation, while now abstract and in control of the account owner rather than the protocol, should still be a simple operation. This is why in the future, Starknet will place max steps limitation upon the __validate__ function. Even if the validation is simple, we could still face the following attack: An attacker fills the mempool with transactions that are valid at time T. A sequencer may start executing them, thinking that at the time he will produce his block, they will still be valid. However, shortly after, at time T', the attacker sends one transaction that somehow invalidates all the previous ones and makes sure it’s included before the sequencer gets to publish his block (the attacker may do this by offering higher fees for this one transaction). As a concrete example, think of many __validate__ functions checking that the value of a storage slot is 1 and the attacker’s transaction later sets it to 0. To handle this issue, we add some further limitations. Currently, Starknet enforces that __validate__ does not call external contracts. The property that we achieve with the above restrictions is that a single storage update may only invalidate transactions from a single account (this is the best we can do, an account can always invalidate its own past transactions by changing its keys). Thus, the price (in fees) required to invalidate transactions in the mempool is linear in the number of unique accounts that we want to invalidate. The purpose of the __execute__ function is to abstract away the remaining actions performed by a transaction. In Ethereum, a transaction is necessarily a call to a specific function in a smart contract. With the __execute__ abstraction, the account designer controls the flow of the transaction. For example, multicalls can be natively supported in your account, saving the need to send multiple transactions (in practice, this is even harder to manage without multicalls due to nonces). A transaction is considered reverted when the __execute__ function failed. Today, reverted transactions are not included in blocks, but in the future, they will be and the sequencer will be eligible to charge a fee for the work done up to the point of failure, similar to Ethereum. Currently, the sequencer charges only for successful transactions that result from the successful completion of the __execute__ function.","title":"Validate and execute","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"validate_and_execute","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/validate_and_execute/","titles":[{"text":"The validate function","hash":"the_validate_function","id":1},{"text":"Invalid transactions","hash":"invalid_transactions","id":2},{"text":"Validate limitations","hash":"validate_limitations","id":3},{"text":"The execute function","hash":"the_execute_function","id":4},{"text":"Reverted transactions","hash":"reverted_transactions","id":5}]},"20":{"id":20,"text":"In Starknet, the block is defined as a list of transactions and a block header.

Transaction is not yet known to the sequencer. Transaction was received by the sequencer. Transaction will now either execute successfully or be rejected. Transaction executed successfully and entered the pending block. Transaction passed validation and entered an actual created block on L2. Transaction was accepted on-chain. Transaction executed unsuccessfully and thus was skipped (applies both to a pending and an actual created block). Possible reasons for transaction rejection: An assertion failed during the execution of the transaction (in Starknet, unlike in Ethereum, transaction executions do not always succeed). The block may be rejected on L1, thus changing the transaction status to REJECTED. Today, Starknet supports querying the new block before its construction is complete. This feature improves the responsiveness of the system prior to the decentralization phase, but will probably become obsolete once the system is decentralized, as full nodes will only propagate finalized blocks through the network. During the construction of the block, as it is accumulating new transactions, the block’s status is PENDING. While status is PENDING, new transactions are dynamically added to the block. Once the sequencer decides to close the block, it becomes ACCEPTED_ON_L2 and its hash is computed. The following example is a query for the pending mainnet block: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/get_block?blockNumber=pending See the CLI section for information on how to call the gateway with respect to the pending block.

Next, the user would submit the compilation output (the contract class) to the Starknet sequencer via a declare transaction. With Cairo 1.0, the contract class resulting from compiling Cairo 1.0 does not include Casm. Instead of Casm, it includes instructions in an intermediate representation called Sierra (Safe Intermediate Representation). This new contract class is then compiled by the sequencer, via the Sierra → Casm compiler, to generate the Cairo assembly associated with this class. Starknet is a validity rollup, which means that the execution inside every block needs to be proven, and this is where STARKs come in handy. However, STARK proofs can address statements that are formulated in the language of polynomial constraints, and have no knowledge of smart contract execution. To overcome this gap, we developed Cairo. Cairo instructions (which we referred to previously as Casm) are translated to polynomial constraints that enforce the correct execution of a program (according to semantics the of Cairo). Thanks to Cairo, we can formulate the statement \"this Starknet block is valid\" in a way that we can prove. Note that we can only prove things about Casm. That is, regardless of what the user sends to the Starknet sequencer, what’s proven is the correct Casm execution. This means that we need a way to translate Sierra into Casm, and this is achieved with the Sierra → Casm compiler. To understand why we chose to add an additional layer between the code that the user writes (Cairo 1.0) and the code that is being proven (Casm), we need to consider more components in the system and the limitations of Cairo. A crucial property of every decentralized L2 is that the sequencers are guaranteed to be compensated for the work they do. The notion of reverted transactions is a good example: even if the user’s transaction failed mid-execution, the sequencer should be able to include it in a block and charge execution fees up to the point of failure. If the sequencer cannot charge for such transactions, then sending transactions that will eventually fail (after a lot of computation steps) is an obvious DOS attack on the sequencer. However, the sequencer cannot look at a transaction and conclude that it would fail without actually doing the work (this is equivalent to solving the undecidable halting problem). The obvious solution to the above predicament is to include such transactions in the block, similar to Ethereum. However, this may not be as simple to do in a validity rollup. With Cairo 0, there is no separating layer between the user code and what is being proven. This means that users can write code that is unprovable in some cases. In fact, such code is very easy to write, e.g. assert 0=1 is a valid Cairo instruction that cannot be proven, as it translates to polynomial constraints that are not satisfiable. As such, any Casm execution that contains this instruction cannot be proven. Sierra is, therefore, the layer between the user code and the provable statement, that allows us to make sure all transactions are eventually provable. The method by which Sierra guarantees that user code is always provable is by compiling Sierra instructions to a subset of Casm, which we call \"safe Casm\". The important property that we require from safe Casm is being provable for all inputs. A canonical example of safe Casm is using if/else instructions instead of assert, i.e. making sure all failures are graceful. To better understand the considerations that go into designing the Sierra → Casm compiler, consider the find_element function from the common library of Cairo 0: func find_element{range_check_ptr}(array_ptr: felt*, elm_size, n_elms, key) -> (elm_ptr: felt*) { alloc_locals; local index; %{ ... %} assert_nn_le(a=index, b=n_elms - 1); tempvar elm_ptr = array_ptr + elm_size * index; assert [elm_ptr] = key; return (elm_ptr=elm_ptr); } Below we abuse the \"Casm\" notation by not distinguishing Cairo 0 from Casm and referring to the above as Casm (while we actually refer to the compilation result of the above). For brevity, we have omitted the hint in the above snippet, but it’s clear that this function can only execute correctly if the requested element exists in the array (otherwise it would fail for every possible hint, as there is nothing we can substitute index for that will make the following lines run successfully). Such Casm cannot be generated by the Sierra→Casm compiler. Furthermore, simply replacing the assertion with an if/else statement doesn’t do, as this results in a non-deterministic execution (that is, different hint values can yield different results for the same input). A malicious prover can use this freedom to harm the user - in this example, they are able to make it seem as if an element isn’t part of the array, even though it actually is. The safe Casm for finding an element in an array behaves like the above snippet in the happy flow (the element is there): an index is given in a hint, and we verify that the array at the hinted index contains the requested element. However, in the unhappy flow (the element isn’t there), we must go over the entire array to verify this. This was not the case in Cairo 0, as we were fine with certain paths not being provable (in the above snippet, the unhappy flow in which the element isn’t in the array is never provable). Sierra’s gas metering adds further complications to the above example. If we take gas limitations into consideration, the user may have enough gas for the happy flow, but not for the unhappy one, making the execution stop mid-search, and allowing the prover to get away with lying about the element not being present. The way we plan to handle this is by requiring the user to have enough gas for the unhappy flow before actually calling find_element. Smart contracts written with Cairo 1.0 cannot contain user-defined hints. This is already somewhat true for Cairo 0 contracts (only whitelisted hints are accepted), but with Cairo 1.0 the hints in use are determined only by the Sierra → Casm compiler. Since this compilation is there to ensure that only safe Casm is generated, there is no room for hints that are not generated by the compiler. In the future, native Cairo 1.0 may contain hint syntax similar to Cairo 0, but it will not be available in Starknet smart contracts (such functionality may be used by L3s on top of Starknet). Note that this is currently not part of Starknet’s roadmap.","title":"Cairo 1.0 and Sierra","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"cairo-1-and-sierra","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Cairo_on_Starknet/cairo-1-and-sierra/","titles":[{"text":"Why do we need Casm?","hash":"why_do_we_need_casm","id":1},{"text":"Why do we need Sierra?","hash":"why_do_we_need_sierra","id":2},{"text":"Reverted transactions, unsatisfiable AIRs, and DOS attacks","hash":"reverted_transactions_unsatisfiable_airs_and_dos_attacks","id":3},{"text":"Safe Casm","hash":"safe_casm","id":4},{"text":"Hints in Cairo 1.0","hash":"hints_in_cairo_1_0","id":5}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"With the v2.0.0 release of the Cairo compiler, the Starknet contract syntax has evolved.

Outside the contract module, Starknet related attributes are expected to have the starknet:: prefix. old new #[contract] mod CounterContract { ... } #[starknet::contract] mod CounterContract { ... } Anotate the Storage struct with the #[storage] attribute old new struct Storage { counter: u128, other_contract: IOtherContractDispatcher } #[storage] struct Storage { counter: u128, other_contract: IOtherContractDispatcher } Gather your contract’s external and view function signatures under a trait annotated with #[starknet::interface]: Add a generic parameter to the trait, here we use the name TContractState as it stands for the state of your contract For view functions, add the self: @TContractState argument For external functions, add the ref self: TContractState argument Static functions that do not touch storage or emit events do not require an addition argument old new #[contract] mod CounterContract { #[external] fn increase_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[external] fn decrease_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[view] fn get_counter() -> u128 { ... } } #[starknet::interface] trait ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn decrease_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn get_counter(self: @TContractState) -> u128; } #[starknet::contract] mod CounterContract { ... } Add the external and view function bodies under an impl of the interface trait, and mark the impl with the [external(v0)] attribute old new #[contract] mod CounterContract { #[external] fn increase_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[external] fn decrease_counter(amount: u128) { ... } #[view] fn get_counter() -> u128 { ... } } #[starknet::interface] trait ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn decrease_counter(ref self: TContractState, amount: u128); fn get_counter(self: @TContractState) -> u128; } #[starknet::contract] mod CounterContract { #[external(v0)] impl CounterContract of super::ICounterContract { fn increase_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { ... } fn decrease_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { ... } fn get_counter(self: @ContractState) -> u128 { ... } } } These attributes are responsible for generating the dispatcher type, used to call the contract. Replace the [abi] attribute with [starknet::interface]. While it doesn’t affect the generated code, we recommended adding to the trait a generic parameter T representing the contract’s state, and adding the ref self: T argument to external functions and self: @T argument for view functions. old new #[abi] trait IOtherContract { fn decrease_allowed() -> bool; } #[starknet::interface] trait IOtherContract { fn decrease_allowed(self: @TContractState) -> bool; } Modify storage access to happen through ContractState or @ContractState (none external functions in the contract that access storage also need to get it as an argument). old new let current = counter::read(); let current = self.counter.read(); Unify all the contract’s events under the Event enum, and add a corresponding struct for every variant (all the structs must derive the Event trait, and each member type has to implement the Serde trait) old new #[event] fn counter_increased(amount: u128) {} #[event] fn counter_decreased(amount: u128) {} #[event] #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] enum Event { CounterIncreased: CounterIncreased, CounterDecreased: CounterDecreased } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterIncreased { amount: u128 } #[derive(Drop, starknet::Event)] struct CounterDecreased { amount: u128 } Emit events via the ContractState type old new fn increase_counter(amount: u128) { ... counter_increased(amount); } fn increase_counter(ref self: ContractState, amount: u128) { ... self.emit(CounterIncreased { amount }); }","title":"Contract syntax - migration guide","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"contract-syntax","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Cairo_on_Starknet/contract-syntax/","titles":[{"text":"New contract syntax - concrete steps for migrating","hash":"new_contract_syntax_concrete_steps_for_migrating","id":1},{"text":"Contract anotation","hash":"contract_anotation","id":2},{"text":"Storage anotation","hash":"storage_anotation","id":3},{"text":"Contract interface","hash":"contract_interface","id":4},{"text":"Add interface Impl","hash":"add_interface_impl","id":5},{"text":"Replace the abi attribute with starknet::interface","hash":"replace_the_abi_attribute_with_starknetinterface","id":6},{"text":"Storage access","hash":"storage_access","id":7},{"text":"Events definition","hash":"events_definition","id":8},{"text":"Events emition","hash":"events_emition","id":9}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"The class hash is a hash chain of the definition of the class.

A contract class is the definition of the contract: Cairo byte code, hint information, entry point names, and everything that defines its semantics unambiguously. Each class is identified by its class hash, which is analogous to a class name in an object-oriented programming language. A contract instance is a deployed contract corresponding to a class. Notice that only contract instances behave as contracts in that they have their own storage and can be called by transactions or other contracts. A contract class does not necessarily have a deployed instance in Starknet. New classes can be added to the state of Starknet with the declare transaction. New instances of a previously declared class can be deployed via the deploy system call. To use the functionality of a declared class, without deploying an instance of that class, you can use the library_call system call. This system call is an analogue of Ethereum’s delegate call in the world of classes. You can use class code directly, instead of having a placeholder contract deployed, which is used only for its code.","title":"Contract Classes","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"contract-classes","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Contracts/contract-classes/","titles":[{"text":"Using Classes","hash":"using_classes","id":1}]},"29":{"id":29,"text":"The contract’s storage is a persistent storage space where you can read, write, modify, and persist data. The storage is a map with \\(2^{251}\\) slots, where each slot is a felt which is initialized to 0. The basic function for writing to storage writes value to key is: Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 storage_write(key, value); storage_write_syscall(address_domain, address, value) Both are system calls that can be imported by adding the line: Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 from starkware.starknet.common.syscalls import storage_read, storage_write use starknet::syscalls::storage_read_syscall; use starknet::syscalls::storage_write_syscall; Another basic function is used for getting the storage address, this function is created by the compiler when defining a storage variable, as explained below. This function returns the address of the storage variable. Below we discuss how this address is determined from the variable’s name and keys. The most common way for interacting with a contract’s storage is through storage variables. The @storage_var decorator declares a variable that will be kept as part of the contract storage. The variable can consist of a single felt, or it can be a mapping from multiple arguments to a tuple of felts or structs. To use this variable, the var.read(args), var.write(args, value) and var.addr(args) functions are automatically created by the @storage_var decorator, for reading the storage value, writing the storage value and getting the storage address, respectively. The Starknet contract compiler generates the Cairo code that maps the storage variable’s name and argument values to an address — so that it can be part of the generated proof. The address of a storage variable is computed as follows: If it is a single value, then the address is sn_keccak(variable_name), where variable_name is the ASCII encoding of the variable’s name. If it is a (nested) mapping, then the address of the value at key k_1,...,k_n is h(...h(h(sn_keccak(variable_name),k_1),k_2),...,k_n) where \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash and the final value is taken \\(\\bmod 2^{251}-256\\) If it is a mapping to complex values (e.g., tuples or structs), then this complex value lies in a continuous segment starting from the address calculated in the previous point. Note that 256 field elements is the current limitation on the maximal size of a complex storage value. Note that when calling var.addr(args) for a storage variable with complex values, the returned value is the address of the first element in the storage. We can summarize the above as follows: storage variable address := pedersen(keccak(variable name), keys) In the following example we define a storage variables with complex values.

The Starknet contract language supports these operations by using system calls. System calls enable a contract to require services from the Starknet OS.

Same as the library_call system call, but also enables you to call an L1 handler that cannot otherwise be called directly. For more information, see Starknet’s messaging mechanism (note that when you invoke an L1 handler with this system call, the sequencer does not consume an L1→L2 message).

This system call includes the message parameters as part of the proof’s output and exposes these parameters to the Starknet Core contract on L1 once the state update, including the transaction, is received. For more information, see Starknet’s messaging mechanism. to_address The recipient’s L1 address. payload_size The size of the message payload. payload A pointer to an array containing the contents of the message.

After calling replace_class, the code currently executing from the old class will finish running. The new class will be used from the next transaction onwards or if the contract is called via the call_contract syscall in the same transaction (after the replacement). class_hash The hash of the class you want to use as a replacement. None. syscalls.cairo func storage_read{syscall_ptr : felt*}(address : felt) -> (value : felt) Gets the value of a key in the storage of the calling contract. This system call provides direct access to any possible key in storage, in contrast with var.read(), which enables you to read storage variables that are defined explicitly in the contract.

Each event contains the following fields: from_address: address of the contract emitting the events keys: a list of field elements data: a list of field elements The keys can be used for indexing the events, while the data may contain any information that we wish to log (note that we are dealing with two separate lists of possibly varying size, rather than a list of key-value pairs). Events can be defined in a contract using the @event decorator. Once an event E has been defined, the compiler automatically adds the function E.emit(). The following example illustrates how an event is defined and emitted: Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 @event func message_received(a : felt, b: felt): end #[event] fn Transfer(from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, value: u256) {} Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 message_received.emit(1, 2); Transfer(12345, 12345, 1) The emit function emits an event with a single key, which is an identifier of the event, given by \\(\\text{sn_keccak(event_name)}\\), where \\(\\text{event_name}\\) is the ASCII encoding of the event’s name and \\(\\text{sn_keccak}\\) is defined here. To emit custom keys, one should use the low level emit_event system call: Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 from starkware.starknet.common.syscalls import emit_event # ... let (keys : felt*) = alloc() assert keys[0] = 'status' assert keys[1] = 'deposit' let (data : felt*) = alloc() assert data[0] = 1 assert data[1] = 2 assert data[2] = 3 emit_event(2, keys, 3, data) use starknet::syscalls::emit_event_syscall; let keys = ArrayTrait::new(); keys.append('key'); keys.append('deposit'); let values = ArrayTrait::new(); values.append(1); values.append(2); values.append(3); emit_event_syscall(keys, values).unwrap_syscall(); The above code emits an event with two keys, the strings \"status\" and \"deposit\" (think of those as identifiers of the event that can be used for indexing) and three data elments 1, 2, 3. When using the higher level emit syntax, the event’s data may be of complex types, for example: struct Point: member x : felt member y : felt end @event func message_received(arr_len : felt, arr: felt*, p: Point): end # ... let (data : felt*) = alloc() assert data[0] = 1 assert data[1] = 2 let p = Point(3,4) message_received.emit(2, data, p) The emitted events are part of the transaction receipt. The event definition appears in the contract’s ABI. It contains the list of data fields (name and type) and the list of the custom keys (that is, all keys except the event identifier discussed above). Below is an example of an event inside the ABI: Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 { \"data\": [ { \"name\": \"a\", \"type\": \"felt\" }, { \"name\": \"b\", \"type\": \"felt\" } ], \"keys\": [], \"name\": \"message_received\", \"type\": \"event\" } { \"type\": \"event\", \"name\": \"Transfer\", \"inputs\": [ { \"name\": \"from\", \"type\": \"core::starknet::contract_address::ContractAddress\" }, { \"name\": \"to\", \"type\": \"core::starknet::contract_address::ContractAddress\" }, { \"name\": \"value\", \"type\": \"core::integer::u256\" } ] } The event hash is given by: \\[h(h(h(h(0,\\text{from_address}),\\text{keys_hash}),\\text{data_hash}),3)\\] Where: \\(\\text{keys_hash}\\), \\(\\text{data_hash}\\) are the hashes of the keys list and data list correspondingly (see array hashing). \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash function.

If you want to skip the motivation and deep dive into the mechanism, you can skip directly to the final formula. This section focuses on fees paid by an account on L2. For information about messaging fees that are paid on L1, see L1 → L2 message fees. Users can specify the maximum fee that they are willing to pay for a transaction via the max_fee field. The only limitation on the sequencer (enforced by the Starknet OS) is that the actual fee charged is bounded by max_fee, but for now, StarkWare’s sequencer will only charge the fee required to cover the proof cost (potentially less than the max fee). Presently, the sequencer only takes into account L1 costs involving proof submission. There are two components affecting the L1 footprint of a transaction: Computational complexity: the heavier the transaction, the larger its portion in the proof verification cost. On chain data: L1 calldata cost originating from data availability and L2→L1 messages. The fee is denominated in ETH (this may change in future versions). Each transaction is associated with a gas estimate (explained below), and combining this with the gas price yields the estimated fee. Let’s analyze the correct metric for measuring transaction complexity. For simplicity, we will ignore Cairo’s builtins for the sake of the explanation, and later see how to address them. Recall that a Cairo program execution yields an execution trace. When proving a Starknet block, we aggregate all the transactions appearing in that block to the execution trace. Starknet’s prover generates proofs for execution traces, up to some maximal length \\(L\\) (Derived from the specs of the proving machine and the desired proof latency). Tracking the execution trace length associated with each transaction is simple. Each assertion over field elements (such as verifying addition/multiplication over the field) requires the same, constant number of trace cells (this is where our “no-builtins” assumption kicks in! Obviously Pedersen occupies more trace cells than addition). Therefore, in a world without builtins, the fee of the transaction \\(tx\\) is correlated with \\(\\text{TraceCells}[tx]/L\\). The Cairo execution trace is separated — and each builtin has its own slot. We have to mind this slot allocation when determining the fee. Let’s go over a concrete example first. For example, imagine the following trace that the prover will occupy: (up to) 500,000,000 Cairo Steps (up to) 20,000,000 Pedersen hashes (up to) 4,000,000 signature verifications (up to) 10,000,000 range checks The proof will be closed and sent to L1 when any of these components becomes full. It’s important to realize that the division to builtins must be predetermined! We can’t decide on the fly to have proof with 20,000,001 Pedersen and nothing else. Suppose, for example, that a transaction uses 10,000 Cairo steps and 500 Pedersen hashes. We can squeeze at most 40,000 such transactions into our hypothetical trace (20,000,000/500). Therefore, its gas price will be correlated with 1/40,000 of the cost of submitting proof. Notice we completely ignored the number of Cairo steps in this transaction performance estimation, as it is not the limiting factor (since 500,000,000/10,000 > 20,000,000/500). With this example in mind, we can now formulate the exact fee associated with L2 computation. For each transaction, the sequencer calculates a vector CairoResourceUsage holding: Number of Cairo steps Number of applications of each Cairo builtin (e.g., five range checks and two Pedersen hashes) The sequencer crosses this information with the CairoResourceFeeWeights vector. For each resource type (step or a specific builtin application), CairoResourceFeeWeights has an entry that specifies the relative gas cost of that component in the proof. Going back to the above example, if the cost of submitting a proof with 20,000,000 Pedersen hashes is roughly 5m gas, then the weight of the Pedersen builtin is 0.25 gas per application (5,000,000/20,000,000). The sequencer has a pre-defined weights vector, in accordance with the proof parameters. The sequencer will charge only according to the limiting factor! Therefore the fee is correlated with: \\[\\max_k[\\text{CairoResourceUsage}_k \\cdot \\text{CairoResourceFeeWeights}_k]\\] Where \\(k\\) here enumerates the Cairo resource components, i.e. the number of steps and builtins used. The weights are: Cairo step Pedersen Poseidon Range check ECDSA Bitwise EC_OP 0.01 gas/step 0.32 gas/application 0.32 gas/application 0.16 gas/application 20.48 gas/application 0.64 gas/application 10.24 gas/application The on-chain data associated with a transaction is composed of three parts Storage updates L2→L1 messages Deployed contracts Whenever a transaction updates a key at the storage of some contract, the following data reaches L1: Contract_address Number of updated keys in that contract Key to update New value Note that only the most recent value reaches L1. That is, the transaction’s fee only depends on the number of unique storage updates (if the same storage cell is updated multiple times within the transaction, the fee remains that of a single update). Consequently, the associated storage update fee for a transaction updating \\(n\\) unique contracts and \\(m\\) unique keys is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot c_w\\cdot\\underbrace{(2n+2m)}_{\\text{number of words}}\\] where \\(c_w\\) is the calldata cost (in gas) per 32-byte word. Note that there are many possible improvements to the above pessimistic estimation that will be gradually presented in future versions of Starknet. For example, if different transactions within the same block update the same storage cell, there is no need to charge both of them (only the latest value reaches L1). In the future, Starknet may include a refund mechanism for such cases. When a transaction that raises the send_message_to_l1 syscall is included in a state update, the following data reaches L1: L2 sender address L1 destination address Payload size Payload (list of field elements) Consequently, the fee associated with a single L2→L1 message is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot c_w\\cdot(3+\\text{payload_size})\\] where \\(c_w\\) is the calldata cost (in gas) per 32-byte word. When a transaction that raises the deploy syscall is included in a state update, the following data reaches L1: Contract address Class hash Consequently, the fee associated with a single deployment is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot 2 c_w\\] where \\(c_w\\) is the calldata cost (in gas) per 32-byte word. The fee for a transaction with: Cairo usage represented by the vector \\(v\\) (the entries of \\(v\\) correspond to the number of steps and number of applications per builtin) \\(n\\) unique contract updates \\(m\\) unique key updates \\(t\\) messages with payload sizes \\(q_1,...,q_t\\) \\(\\ell\\) contract deployments is given by: \\[F = \\text{gas_price}\\cdot\\left(\\max_k v_k w_k + c_w\\left(2(n+m) + 3t + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^t q_i + 2\\ell\\right)\\right)\\] where \\(w\\) is the weights vector discussed above and \\(c_w\\) is the calldata cost (in gas) per 32-byte word. The fee is charged atomically with the transaction execution on L2. The Starknet OS injects a transfer of the fee-related ERC-20, with an amount equal to the fee paid, the sender equal to the transaction submitter, and the sequencer as a receiver.","title":"Fee mechanism","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"fee-mechanism","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Fees/fee-mechanism/","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":1},{"text":"Fee units","hash":"fee_units","id":2},{"text":"How much fee is charged?

Let \\(\\text{hades}\\) denote the Hades permutation (with Starknet’s parameters), then given an array \\(a_1,...,a_n\\) of \\(n\\) field elements we define \\(poseidon(a_1,...,a_n)\\) to be the first coordinate of \\(H(a_1,...,a_n;0,0,0)\\), where: \\[H(a_1,...,a_n;s_1,s_2,s_3)=\\begin{cases} H\\big(a_3,...,a_n;\\text{hades}(s_1+a_1, s_2+a_2, s_3)\\big), & \\text{if } n\\ge 2 \\\\ \\text{hades}(s_1+a_1,s_2+1,s_3), & \\text{if } n=1 \\\\ \\text{hades}(s_1+1,s_2,s_3), & \\text{if } n=0 \\\\ \\end{cases}\\] The exact parameters defining the permutation used in Starknet.

During the execution of a Starknet transaction, a contract on Starknet sends an L2→L1 message by calling the send_message_to_L1 syscall. The message parameters (which contain the recipient contract on L1 and the relevant data) are then attached to the relevant state update that includes this syscall invocation. For example: let (message_payload : felt*) = alloc() assert message_payload[0] = // potentially add more elements to message_payload (message_payload[1], message_payload[2], etc.) assert_lt_felt(to_address, ETH_ADDRESS_BOUND) assert_not_zero(to_address) send_message_to_l1(to_address=to_address, payload_size=1, payload=message_payload) After the state update that included this transaction is proved and the L1 state is updated, the message is stored on L1 in the Starknet Core Contract (and the relevant counter is increased), and the LogMessageToL1 event (which contains the message parameters) is emitted. Later, the recipient address on L1 can access and consume the message as part of an L1 transaction by re-supplying the message parameters. This is done by calling consumeMessageFromL2 in the Starknet Core Contract, who verifies that the hash corresponds to a stored message and that the caller is indeed the recipient on L1. In such a case, the reference count of the message hash in the Starknet Core Contract decreases by 1. The above flow is illustrated in the following diagram: As demonstrated above, the structure of an L2 → L1 message is given by: Table 1. L2 → L1 Message FromAddress ToAddress Payload FieldElement EthereumAddress Payload The hash of an L2 → L1 message is computed on L1 as follows: keccak256( abi.encodePacked( FromAddress, ToAddress, Payload.length, Payload ) ); As the hash of the message being sent needs to be written to L1 storage (in the Starknet Core contract) there is always a fixed 20k gas cost associated with sending an L2 to L1 message. Contracts on L1 can interact asynchronously with contracts on L2 via the L1→L2 messaging protocol. The protocol consists of the following stages: An L1 contract initiates a message to an L2 contract on Starknet. It does so by calling the sendMessageToL2 function on the Starknet Core Contract with the message parameters. The Starknet Core Contract hashes the message parameters and updates the L1→L2 message mapping to indicate that a message with this hash was indeed sent. In fact, the L1 contract records the fee that the sender paid. For more information, see L1 → L2 message fees. The message is then decoded into a Starknet transaction that invokes a function annotated with the l1_handler decorator on the target contract. Transactions like this on L2 are called L1 handler transactions. The Starknet sequencer, upon seeing enough L1 confirmations for the transaction that sent the message, initiates the corresponding L2 transaction. The L2 transaction invokes the relevant l1_handler. The L1 Handler transaction that was created in the previous step is added to a proof. The state update is received on the Core contract. the message is cleared from the Core contract’s storage. At this point, the message is handled. The above flow is illustrated in the following diagram: An L1→L2 message consists of: The L1 sender address The recipient contract address on Starknet Function selector Calldata array Message nonce Message nonce The message nonce is maintained on the Starknet Core contract on L1, and is bumped whenever a message is sent to L2. It is used to avoid hash collisions between different L1 handler transactions that are induced by the same message being sent on L1 multiple times (see below). Imagine a scenario where a user transfers an asset from L1 to L2. The flow starts with the user sending the asset to a Starknet bridge and the corresponding L1→L2 message generation. Now, imagine that the L2 message consumption doesn’t function (this might happen due to a bug in the dApp’s Cairo contract). This could result in the user losing custody over their asset forever. To mitigate this risk, we allow the contract that initiated the L1→L2 message to cancel it after declaring the intent and waiting a suitable amount of time. The user starts by calling startL1ToL2MessageCancellation with the relevant message parameters in the Starknet Core Contract. Then, after a five days delay, the user can finalize the cancellation by calling cancelL1ToL2Message. The reason for the delay is to protect the sequencer from a DOS attack in the form of repeatedly sending and canceling a message before it is included in L1, rendering the L2 block which contains the activation of the corresponding L1 handler invalid. Note that this flow should only be used in edge cases such as bugs on the Layer 2 contract preventing message consumption. An L1 → L2 message induces a transaction on L2, which, unlike regular transactions, is not sent by an account. This calls for a different mechanism for paying the transaction’s fee, for otherwise the sequencer has no incentive of including L1 handler transactions inside a block. To avoid having to interact with both L1 and L2 when sending a message, L1 → L2 messages are payable on L1, by sending ETH with the call to the payable function sendMessageToL2 on the Starknet Core contract. The sequencer takes this fee in exchange for handling the message. The sequencer charges the fee in full upon updating the L1 state with the consumption of this message. The fee itself is calculated in the same manner as \"regular\" L2 transactions. You can use the CLI to get an estimate of an L1 → L2 message fee. For completeness, we describe the precise structure of both the message as it appears on L1 and the induced transaction as it appears on L2. Table 2. L1 → L2 Message FromAddress ToAddress Selector Payload Nonce EthereumAddress FieldElement FieldElement List FieldElement The hash of the message is computed on L1 as follows: keccak256( abi.encodePacked( uint256(FromAddress), ToAddress, Nonce, Selector, Payload.length, Payload ) ); Table 3.

Each supported token is associated with an L1 and L2 bridge contract that is communicating via Starknet’s messaging mechanism. The bridges facilitate a user’s ability to conduct their transactions with their ETH and ERC-20 tokens that reside on L1, via the Starknet Alpha network and its STARK-based computational compression capabilities. For simplicity, we use terms such as “deposit”, “transact”, and “transfer” to refer to various operations involving a bridge, even though ETH and ERC20 tokens never actually leave Ethereum. In order to reduce the risks involved in using an Alpha version, StarkGate Alpha on Mainnet has limitations involving the deposit amount and total value locked in the L1 bridge contract: Token Max total value locked ETH 80,000 ETH DAI 5,000,000 DAI USDC 40,000,000 USDC USDT 10,000,000 USDT WBTC 30 WBTC We plan to gradually ease these limitations and lift them completely, as confidence grows. Changes will be updated here, stay tuned. The user calls the function deposit (see ERC-20 deposit and ETH deposit), supplying as parameters the recipient address on Starknet and the amount to transfer in the case of ERC-20 token. The deposit function then: Checks that the funds transferred are within the Alpha limitations Transfers the funds from the user account to the Starknet bridge Emits a deposit event with the sender address on L1, the recipient address on L2, and the amount Sends a message to the relevant L2 bridge with the amount to be transferred, and the recipient address as parameters. Note that, since every single bridge is dedicated to one token type, the token type doesn’t have to be explicit here. At the end of this step (i.e., after the execution on L1) the deposit transaction is known to Starknet’s sequencer, yet sequencers may wait for enough L1 confirmations before the corresponding deposit transaction is initiated on L2. During this step, the status of the L2 deposit transaction is NOT_RECEIVED. Once enough block confirmations are received for step 1, the sequencers may refer to the deposit request by triggering the L1 handler using the handle_deposit function on the L2 bridge. The function handle_deposit verifies that the deposit indeed came from the corresponding L1 bridge. It then calls to the relevant ERC-20 contract (e.g. the ERC-20 representing ETH on Starknet) and mints the tokens for the user. At the end of this step (i.e., after the sequencer processed this transaction, but before a proof is generated), the status of the deposit request will be ACCEPTED_ON_L2. Once the sequencer completes the block construction, Starknet’s provers will prove its validity and submit a state update to L1. When this happens, the message confirming the funds transfer will be cleared from the Starknet Core Contract, and the fact that the user has transferred their funds will be part of the now finalized state of Starknet. Note that if the message wasn’t on L1 to begin with (meaning Starknet “invented” a deposit request), the state update would fail. To initiate a withdraw, a user calls the initiate_withdraw function on the L2 bridge contract, supplying as parameters the recipient address on Ethereum, as well as the amount to transfer. The withdraw function then: Burns the transferred amount of tokens from the balance of the withdrawal’s initiator Sends a message to the relevant L1 bridge with the amount to be transferred, and the recipient address as parameters. As before, since the bridges are token-specific, the token itself is implicit here. Once the sequencer completes the block construction, Starknet’s provers will prove the validity of the block and submit a state update to L1. When this happens, the message from the previous step is stored in the Starknet Core Contract. After the withdraw message has been recorded on the Starknet Core Contract, anyone can finalize the transfer on L1 from the bridge back to the user, by calling the withdraw function (see ERC-20 withdraw and ETH withdraw). This step is permissionless, and may be performed by anyone. Since the user’s address is part of the recorded message on L1, he will be the recepient of the funds, regardless of who called the withdraw function on L1.","title":"StarkGate bridge","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"token-bridge","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/L1-L2_Communication/token-bridge/","titles":[{"text":"StarkGate general architecture","hash":"starkgate_general_architecture","id":1},{"text":"StarkGate Alpha limitations","hash":"starkgate_alpha_limitations","id":2},{"text":"L1→L2 transfer (deposit)","hash":"l1l2_transfer_deposit","id":3},{"text":"Step 1: Call the deposit function on L1","hash":"step_1_call_the_deposit_function_on_l1","id":4},{"text":"Step 2: deposit triggered on Starknet","hash":"step_2_deposit_triggered_on_starknet","id":5},{"text":"Step 3: The block that includes the transfer is proved","hash":"step_3_the_block_that_includes_the_transfer_is_proved","id":6},{"text":"L2→L1 transfer (withdraw)","hash":"l2l1_transfer_withdraw","id":7},{"text":"Step 1: Call the withdraw function on L2","hash":"step_1_call_the_withdraw_function_on_l2","id":8},{"text":"Step 2: The block that includes the transaction is proved","hash":"step_2_the_block_that_includes_the_transaction_is_proved","id":9},{"text":"Step 3: Transfering the funds on L1","hash":"step_3_transfering_the_funds_on_l1","id":10}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"The state of Starknet consists of: Contract classes: a mapping between class hash and the class definition Contract instances: a mapping between addresses (251-bit field elements) and the contract’s state. A contract state consists of: Class hash: defines the functionality of the contract Contract storage: a key-value mapping where the key/values are field elements Contract nonce: the number of transactions sent from this contract With the above definition, we can provide a brief sketch of Starknet’s transition function. A transaction \\(tx\\) transitions the system from state \\(S\\) to state \\(S'\\) if: \\(tx\\) is an invoke transaction, and the storage of \\(S'\\) is the result of executing the target contract code with respect to the previous state \\(S\\) (the arguments, contract address, and the specific entry point are part of the transaction) \\(tx\\) is a deploy_account transaction, and \\(S'\\) contains the new contract’s state at the contract’s address. Additionally, the storage of \\(S\\) is updated according to the execution of the contract’s constructor. \\(tx\\) is a declare transaction, and \\(S'\\) contains the class hash and definition in the contract classes mapping The state commitment is a digest which uniquely (up to hash collisions) encodes the state. In Starknet, the commitment combines the roots of two binary Merkle-Patricia trees of height 251 in the following manner: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{state_commitment}=h( & \\text{\"STARKNET_STATE_V0\"}, \\\\& \\text{contracts_tree_root}, \\\\& \\text{classes_tree_root}) \\end{aligned}\\] Where: \\(h\\) is the Poseidon hash function STARKNET_STATE_V0 is a constant prefix string encoded in ASCII (and represented as a field element). contracts_tree_root is the root of the Merkle-Patricia tree whose leaves are the contracts states, see below classes_tree_root is the root of the Merkle-Patricia tree whose leaves are the compiled class hashes, see below Like Ethereum, this is a 2-level structure where the contract address determines the path from the root to the leaf encoding the contract state. The information stored in the leaf is: \\[h(h(h(\\text{class_hash}, \\text{storage_root}), \\text{nonce}),0)\\] Where: \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash function. \\(\\text{class_hash}\\) is the hash of the contract’s definition discussed here \\(\\text{storage_root}\\) is the root of another Merkle-Patricia tree of height 251 that is constructed from the contract’s storage \\(\\text{nonce}\\) is the current nonce of the contract The classes tree encodes the information about the existing classes in the state of Starknet. It maps (Cairo 1.0) class hashes to their compiled class hashes. The value of a leaf at a path corresponding to some class hash is given by: \\[h(\\text{CONTRACT_CLASS_LEAF_V0}, \\text{compiled_class_hash})\\] Where: \\(h\\) is the Poseidon hash function CONTRACT_CLASS_LEAF_V0 is a constant prefix string encoded in ASCII (and represented as a field element). compiled_class_hash is the hash of the Cairo assembly resulting from compiling the given class via the Sierra→Casm compiler Cairo 1.0 classes that are part of the commitment are defined with Sierra, an intermediate representation between Cairo 1.0 and Cairo assembly (see here for more information). However, the prover only deals with Cairo assembly. This means that unless we want the compilation from Sierra to Casm to be part of every block in which the class is used, the commitment must have some information about the associated Cairo assembly. Today, the user signs the compiled_class_hash as part of a declare v2 transaction. If the transaction was included in a block, then this compiled_class_hash becomes part of the commitment. In the future, when Sierra→Casm compilation becomes part of the Starknet OS, this value may be updated via a proof of the Sierra→Casm compiler execution, showing that compiling the same class with a newer compiler version results in some new compiled class hash. As mentioned above, our commitment scheme uses a binary Merkle-Patricia tree with the Pedersen hash function. Each node in the tree is represented by a triplet \\((length, path, bottom)\\). The actual data is placed in the leaves, and a leaf node with data \\(x\\) is encoded by the triplet \\((0,0,x)\\). Empty nodes (leaves or internal) are encoded by the zero triplet \\((0,0,0)\\). A subtree rooted at a node \\((length, path, bottom)\\) has a single non-empty subtree, rooted at the node obtained by following the path specified by \\(path\\). \\(path\\) is an integer in \\([0, 2^{length}-1]\\), and the binary expansion of \\(path\\) indicates how should we proceed along the tree, where the first step is indicated by the most significant bit, and \\(0,1\\) are interpreted as left, right correspondingly. The reason that length is specified and cannot be deduced from \\(path\\) is that we’re dealing with field elements of fixed size (251 bits each). For a node with \\(length>0\\), following \\(path\\) leads the highest node whose both right and left child are none empty. The following rules specify how the tree is constructed from a given set of leaves: The hash of a node \\(N =(length, path, bottom)\\), denoted by \\(H(N)\\), is: \\[H(N)=\\begin{cases} bottom, & \\text{if } length = 0 \\\\ h(bottom, path) + length, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] Note that any arithmetic operations in the above are done in our field. We can now proceed to recursively define the nodes in the tree. The triplet represents the parent of the nodes \\(left=(\\ell_L, p_L, b_L)\\), \\(right=(\\ell_R, p_R, b_R)\\) is given by: \\[parent= \\begin{cases} (0,0,0), & \\text{if } left=right=(0,0,0)\\\\ (\\ell_L + 1, p_L, b_L), & \\text{if } right=(0,0,0) \\text{ and } left \\neq (0,0,0)\\\\ (\\ell_R + 1, p_R + 2^{\\ell_R}, b_R), & \\text{if } right\\neq (0,0,0) \\text{ and } left = (0,0,0)\\\\ (0, 0, h(H(left), H(right))), & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] We now show an example of the construction of a height 3 Merkle-Patricia tree from the leaves \\([0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\\): Where \\(r=h(H(2,2,1),H((2,1,1))\\). Note that in our example there is no skipping from the root (length is zero), so the final commitment to the tree will be \\(H((0,0,r))=r\\). Suppose that we want to prove, with respect to the commitment we have just computed, that the value of the leaf whose path is given by \\(101\\) is \\(1\\). In a standard Merkle tree, the proof would have consisted of data from three nodes (siblings along the path to the root). Here, since the tree is sparse, we only need to send the two children of the root \\((2,2,1), (2,1,1)\\). This suffices to reproduce the commitment \\(r\\), and since the height of the tree, \\(3\\), is known and fixed, we know that the path \\(01\\) of length \\(2\\) specified by the right child \\((2,1,1)\\) leads us to the desired leaf.","title":"Starknet state","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"starknet-state","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/State/starknet-state/","titles":[{"text":"State commitment","hash":"state_commitment","id":1},{"text":"The contracts tree","hash":"contracts_tree","id":2},{"text":"The classes tree","hash":"classes_tree","id":3},{"text":"Merkle-Patricia tree","hash":"merkle_patricia_tree","id":4},{"text":"Specifications","hash":"specifications","id":5},{"text":"Example trie","hash":"example_trie","id":6}]},"40":{"id":40,"text":"An asterisk (*) denotes required arguments.

If supplied, the debug information from the compiled contract will be used to add error locations. error_message - if specified, only the error message will be returned (or empty response in case the transaction was successful) The possible statuses of a transaction are: NOT_RECEIVED RECEIVED PENDING REJECTED ACCEPTED_ON_L2 ACCEPTED_ON_L1 Refer to this section for more information about the transaction lifecycle.","title":"Commands","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"commands","url":"/documentation/tools/CLI/commands/","titles":[{"text":"Basic command line syntax","hash":"basic_command_line_syntax","id":1},{"text":"Setting the Starknet network environment","hash":"setting_the_starknet_network_environment","id":2},{"text":"Setting custom endpoints","hash":"setting_custom_endpoints","id":3},{"text":"starknet call","hash":"starknet_call","id":4},{"text":"starknet declare","hash":"starknet_declare","id":5},{"text":"starknet deploy","hash":"starknet_deploy","id":6},{"text":"starknet deploy_account","hash":"starknet_deploy_account","id":7},{"text":"starknet estimate_fee","hash":"starknet_estimate_fee","id":8},{"text":"starknet estimate_message_fee","hash":"starknet_estimate_message_fee","id":9},{"text":"starknet get_block","hash":"starknet_get_block","id":10},{"text":"starknet get_code","hash":"starknet_get_code","id":11},{"text":"starknet get_storage_at","hash":"starknet_get_storage_at","id":12},{"text":"starknet get_transaction","hash":"starknet_get_transaction","id":13},{"text":"starknet get_transaction_receipt","hash":"starknet_get_transaction_receipt","id":14},{"text":"starknet invoke","hash":"starknet_invoke","id":15},{"text":"starknet tx_status","hash":"starknet_tx_status","id":16}]},"41":{"id":41,"text":"When the Starknet compiler is installed, you can view this command-line help in a terminal by entering the following command: starknet-compile --help starknet-compile [-h] [--abi ABI] [--disable_hint_validation] [--account_contract] [--dont_filter_identifiers] [-v] [--prime PRIME] [--cairo_path CAIRO_PATH] [--preprocess] [--output OUTPUT] [--no_debug_info] [--debug_info_with_source] [--cairo_dependencies CAIRO_DEPENDENCIES] [--no_opt_unused_functions] file [file ...] The following example compiles the file contract.cairo.
