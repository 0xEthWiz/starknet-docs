It provides the following features: Access the full Starknet state history Verifies state using Ethereum Implements the Starknet JSON-RPC API Run Starknet functions without requiring a Starknet transaction Ability to do fee estimation for transactions See the official Pathfinder Github repository for more details. The primary focus of this release is to provide support for Starknet v0.11.1, and will continue to work for v0.11.0. Since this release is required for v0.11.1, you should update your node before the network is updated. Starknet v0.11.1 support CORS support via the rpc.cors-domains configuration option Transaction hashes are now verified as part of the sync process. Previously, these were not verified as the exact algorithm was underdocumented and the transaction format was still evolving. RPC server panic for unprefixed unregistered method names Data can temporarily appear to go missing when transitioning from PENDING to ACCEPTED ON L2 This was commonly seen when rapidly monitoring a new transaction, which would go from PENDING to TXN_HASH_NOT_FOUND to ACCEPTED_ON_L2 as pathfinder moved the ephemeral pending data to latest data on disk. Fixes for minor issues and inconsistencies. max-rpc-connections command-line argument. This sets the maximum number incoming RPC connections the pathfinder node will accept. This defaults to 1024 if not specified. cairo-lang upgraded to 0.11.0.2 starknet_simulateTransaction data model inconsistency poll-pending default value restored to false incoming RPC connections limited to 100. This limit was accidentily introduced in v0.5.2 as part of a dependency upgrade, whereas before it was unlimited. The default is now 1024 and can be configured using --max-rpc-connections. handling of invalid JSON-RPC requests This release fixes a few RPC bugs and adds support for bulk fee estimation and transaction simulation (traces) as part of v0.3 RPC specification. In addition it also adds a pathfinder_getTransactionStatus endpoint which lets you track a transactions status — including REJECTED and RECEIVED — in the same fashion as the gateway. support starknet_estimateFee in the JSON-RPC v0.3 API supports estimating multiple transactions this includes declaring and immediately using a class (not currently possible via the gateway) support starknet_simulateTransaction for JSON-RPC v0.3 supports simulating multiple transactions this includes declaring and immediately using a class (not currently possible via the gateway) support pathfinder_getTransactionStatus which is exposed on all RPC routes this enables querying a transactions current status, including whether the gateway has received or rejected it RPC returns int for entrypoint offsets instead of hex RPC rejects Fee values with more than 32 digits RPC does not expose pathfinder_getProof on v0.3 route This is a minor bugfix release, primarily to fix an issue with syncing on testnet2. pathfinder sometimes spams nethermind L1 nodes pathfinder stops syncing testnet2 at block 95220 due to a Sierra class compilation issue starknet v0.11.0 support RPC API v0.3 partial support removed several deprecated config options requires python 3.9 or 3.10 (no longer 3.8) support for state commitment and class commitment in pathfinder_getProof support for starknet v0.11 partial support for RPC specification v0.3 exposed on /rpc/v0.3/ route missing support for starknet_estimateFee and starknet_simulate starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee JSON-RPC methods return more detailed error messages python version requirement has changed to 3.9 or 3.10 (was 3.8 or 3.9 previously) RPC accepts hex inputs for Felt without '0x' prefix. This led to confusion especially when passing in a decimal string which would get silently interpretted as hex. using a Nethermind Ethereum endpoint occasionally causes errors such as could not be found to be logged. sync can miss new block events by getting stuck waiting for pending data. --config configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) --integration configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) --sequencer-url configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) --testnet2 configuration option (deprecated in [v0.4.1](https://github.com/eqlabs/pathfinder/releases/tag/v0.4.1)) starknet_addDeployTransaction as this is no longer an allowed transaction since starknet v0.10.3 RPC api version 0.1, which used to be served on path /rpc/v0.1 We added support for v0.3 and removed v0.1. We still support v0.2 at both /rpc/v0.2 and /rpc (default) routes. In summary: / # serves v0.2 /rpc/v0.2/ # serves v0.2 /rpc/v0.3/ # serves v0.3 We are missing starknet_estimateFee and starknet_simulate support for v0.3, which will be added in an upcoming release. Note: this only applies if you are building from source. This does not impact docker users. Pathfinder requires python to support the starknet VM used to simulate starknet transactions and function calls. Previous versions of the VM only worked with python 3.8 or 3.9 which was a hassle because most operating systems no longer directly support it. The new version of the VM bundled with starknet v0.11 now requires python version 3.9 or 3.10. Several configuration options are now removed, after they were deprecated in pathfinder v0.4.1. Here is a migration guide: --testnet2: use --network testnet2 instead --integration: use --network integration instead --sequencer-url: use --network custom in combination with --feeder-gateway-url and gateway-url --config: use environment variables or env files as an alternative Hotfix for a bug introduced in the previous version v0.4.4, which prevented a new node from syncing on blocks near genesis. Added Newton FAQ links to readme Node fails to sync old blocks @SecurityQQ made their first contribution in #799 This minor release contains some nice performance improvements for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee as well as some minor bug fixes. Also included is a major new feature: storage proofs - big thanks @pscott for his hard work on this feature! This is available via the pathfinder_getProof method which is served from both the pathfinder and Starknet endpoints for convenience: /rpc/pathfinder/v0.1/pathfinder_getProof /rpc/v0.2/pathfinder_getProof The method is specified here. Its results can be used to formally verify what a contract’s storage values are without trusting the pathfinder node. This is achieved by validating the merkle-proof that pathfinder returns and confirming that it correctly matches the known Starknet state root. storage proofs via pathfinder_getProof by @pscott starknet_getEvents returns all events when from_block=\"latest\" v0.1 starknet_getStateUpdate does not contain nonces Improved performance for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee by caching classes Improved performance for starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee by using Rust for hashing @pscott made their first contribution in #726 The primary purpose of this release is to properly support testnet2 after the Starknet v0.10.3 update. The v0.10.3 update changed the testnet2 chain ID which impacts transaction signatures which in turn meant that starknet_estimateFee would fail for any signed transaction. This release updates pathfinder to use the correct chain ID. Testnet2 and integration flags are ignored starknet_estimateFee uses wrong chain ID for testnet2 Updated to cairo-lang 0.10.3 Contains several bug fixes, mostly hotfixes for bugs introduced in v0.4.1. Document that --chain-id expects text as input Testnet2 and integration L1 addresses are swapped (bug introduced in v0.4.1) Proxy network setups can’t sync historical blocks (bug introduced in v0.4.1) ABI serialization for starknet_estimateFee for declare transactions Soft deprecation of some configuration options Support custom Starknet gateways Pathfinder RPC extensions at /rpc/pathfinder/ with pathfinder_version method starknet_events optimisations fix block timestamp in pending calls Custom Starknet gateway support This release introduces support for custom Starknets. You can select this network by setting --network custom and specifying the --gateway-url and --feeder-gateway-url options. Several configuration options have been soft deprecated. This means using them will continue to work as before (no breaking change), but they will emit a warning when used. They will be removed in a future version, so please migrate to the newer options. To re-emphasize: your current configuration setup will continue to work as is. --testnet2 and --integration have been deprecated in favor of --network testnet2 and --network integration. --sequencer-url has been deprecated in favor of --network custom along with --gateway-url, --feeder-gateway-url and --chain-id. In addition, you will need to rename your existing database file to custom.sqlite as this will be the expected filename for custom networks. --config has been deprecated and will not be supported in the future. The utility this provided was valuable. Unfortunately it is starting to severely hinder how fast we can implement configuration changes and we decided to remove it. We suggest using environment variables along with environment files to configure pathfinder in a similar fashion. The following configuration options are now marked as deprecated: --testnet2, --integration, --config, --sequencer-url Optimized starknet_events for queries with both a block range and a from address Block timestamps for pending in starknet_call and starknet_estimateFee were using the latest timestamp instead of the pending one. This meant contracts relying on accurate timestamps could sometimes fail unexpectedly. Custom Starknet support Pathfinder specific RPC extensions hosted at /rpc/pathfinder/v0.1. Currently, this only contains pathfinder_version which returns the pathfinder version of the node. This release contains a breaking change, and also adds support for Starknet v0.10.2. The changes themselves are quite simple, but please read through each section as there are some caveats which might impact you when you apply this update. This release changes the version of the RPC that is served at the root route, from v0.1 to v0.2 of the RPC specification. Version v0.1 is still available at the /rpc/v0.1/ endpoint. This is the only breaking change in this release. Here is a summary of what routes are currently available, and what’s changed: / serves v0.2 (changed from v0.1) /rpc/v0.1 serves v0.1 (no change) /rpc/v0.2 serves v0.2 (no change) If possible, we recommend that you use the version specific routes as this will prevent such breaking changes from impacting you. This release includes an update to the cairo-vm embedded in pathfinder in order to support the upcoming v0.10.2 Starknet release. This bundled vm is a pre-release and may therefore contain differences to the final version used once Starknet updates testnet and mainnet. We will of course issue a new release if / when there is a new vm. Since these changes are not yet live on testnet nor mainnet, this means upgrading to this release will cause deviations between what pathfinder outputs and what can be expected on the network. More specifically, starknet_estimateFee will compute different fees until the network has upgraded to Starknet v0.10.2. If you don’t need the RPC route changes, it may be pertinent to delay updating until closer to the v0.10.2 release dates on testnet and mainnet. The expected timeline for these upgrades is ~17/11 for testnets and ~24/11 for mainnet.","title":"Pathfinder versions","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"pathfinder_versions","url":"/documentation/starknet_versions/pathfinder_versions/","titles":[{"text":"v0.5.4 (latest)","hash":"v0_5_4_latest","id":1},{"text":"Added","hash":"added","id":2},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed","id":3},{"text":"v0.5.3","hash":"v0_5_3","id":4},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_2","id":5},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_2","id":6},{"text":"v0.5.2","hash":"v0_5_2","id":7},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_3","id":8},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_3","id":9},{"text":"v0.5.1","hash":"v0_5_1","id":10},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_4","id":11},{"text":"v0.5.0","hash":"v0_5_0","id":12},{"text":"Highlights","hash":"highlights","id":13},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_4","id":14},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed","id":15},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_5","id":16},{"text":"Removed","hash":"removed","id":17},{"text":"RPC API","hash":"rpc_api","id":18},{"text":"Python requirement","hash":"python_requirement","id":19},{"text":"Configuration changes","hash":"configuration_changes","id":20},{"text":"v0.4.5","hash":"v0_4_5","id":21},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_5","id":22},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_6","id":23},{"text":"New contributors","hash":"new_contributors","id":24},{"text":"v0.4.4","hash":"v0_4_4","id":25},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_6","id":26},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_7","id":27},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_2","id":28},{"text":"New contributors","hash":"new_contributors_2","id":29},{"text":"v0.4.3","hash":"v0_4_3","id":30},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_8","id":31},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_3","id":32},{"text":"v0.4.2","hash":"v0_4_2","id":33},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_7","id":34},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_9","id":35},{"text":"v0.4.1","hash":"v0_4_1","id":36},{"text":"Highlights","hash":"highlights_2","id":37},{"text":"Configuration option deprecation","hash":"configuration_option_deprecation","id":38},{"text":"Network selection","hash":"network_selection","id":39},{"text":"Gateway proxy","hash":"gateway_proxy","id":40},{"text":"Configuration file","hash":"configuration_file","id":41},{"text":"Changed","hash":"changed_4","id":42},{"text":"Fixed","hash":"fixed_10","id":43},{"text":"Added","hash":"added_8","id":44},{"text":"v0.4.0- (breaking release)","hash":"v0_4_0_breaking_release","id":45},{"text":"Default RPC version change","hash":"default_rpc_version_change","id":46},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.2 support","hash":"starknet_v0_10_2_support","id":47},{"text":"Please take note of the following","hash":"please_take_note_of_the_following","id":48}]},"6":{"id":6,"text":"Starknet’s roadmap for 2023 is focussed on performance and user experience. The upcoming version 0.12.0 of Starknet is focused on enhancing the network’s throughput to improve scale and transaction latency. To achieve this, a new Rust implementation has been introduced for the sequencer. The sequencer contains more efficient local storage and critical path logic implemented, aimed at significantly reducing wait times for transaction confirmations and addressing network congestion issues. While there are minimum changes at the protocol level, the upcoming version introduces significant improvements to the sequencer. Here are some notable changes to expect: The new sequencer’s performance will benefit from the following three enhancements: Cairo-rs: Cairo VM in Rust The blockifier: a transaction execution framework available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license. Local state management of the sequencer will use Papyrus storage. The PENDING transaction status will be removed in v0.12.0. In Starknet, the pending block is a valid block that was executed by the sequencer but is not yet full and more transactions might be added to it. In v0.12.0, the status for transactions in the pending block will be changed from PENDING to ACCEPTED_ON_L2 to reflect their finality status. In v0.12.0, a new syscall will be added that will allow contracts to fetch the block hashes of older blocks (similar to blockhash in Solidity). The syscall will allow access to past blocks in the range (current block-10, current block - 1024). In v0.12.0, the Starknet OS will not prove the correctness of those block hash returned by the syscall. This is temporary and will be proven in the final version of the Starknet OS.","title":"Upcoming Starknet versions","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"upcoming_versions","url":"/documentation/starknet_versions/upcoming_versions/","titles":[{"text":"Starknet Alpha v0.12.0","hash":"starknet_alpha_v0_12_0","id":1},{"text":"What to expect","hash":"what_to_expect","id":2},{"text":"Notable changes","hash":"notable_changes","id":3},{"text":"Sequencer performance","hash":"sequencer_performance","id":4},{"text":"Removal of pending status","hash":"removal_of_pending_status","id":5},{"text":"Block hash syscall","hash":"block_hash_syscall","id":6}]},"7":{"id":7,"text":"The following version notes cover the ongoing version changes to Starknet. To get the latest version updates delivered to you, please subscribe to our mailing list here. Within Starknet’s deployment pipeline there are separate and distinct networks that operate independently of each other for testing before deployment. The current version on each environment are listed within the table below: Environment Starknet version Mainnet V0.11.0 Goerli Testnet 1 V0.11.1 Goerli Testnet 2 V0.11.1 For more information see the useful information section. Minor bug fix in the Starknet CLI. Version 0.11.1 of Starknet is currently in use on Goerli testnet 1 and Goerli testnet 2. Upgrade Cairo 1.0 version to v1.0.0-rc0. Charged transaction fee is now based on an average Ethereum gas price instead of a single sample (estimation API is unaffected). API changes: Remove the state root in get_state_update for pending blocks to allow faster responses in future versions. Testing framework: Allow declaring (and interacting with) Cairo 1.0 contracts. Currently, the Cairo 1.0 ABI is not supported yet, so a Cairo 0 ABI should be supplied to declare() manually. Split deploy() to two phases declare and deploy: deprecated_declare() (for Cairo 0 contract) or declare() (for Cairo 1.0 contracts) and deploy() (for both). Add current block hash to the Starknet Core contract (currently not verified by the Starknet OS): Breaking change: The LogStateUpdate event’s data is changed to include blockHash. Other changes: Change build system from CMake to bazel. Starknet v0.11.0 is live on Mainnet. invoke and declare transactions of version 0 are no longer supported on this version. In Starknet v0.11.0, you can declare, deploy and run Cairo 1.0 smart contracts. We also introduce a new system call that allows a smooth transitioning of existing contracts to a Cairo 1.0 implementation. Historically, contract classes have been defined in terms of Cairo assembly, or Casm for short (the class definition also included more information needed for execution, e.g., hint data). The novelty of Cairo 1.0 is the introduction of Sierra (Safe Intermediate Representation), an intermediate layer between Cairo 1.0 and Casm. The introduction of Cairo 1.0 and Sierra has several effects on the system. Below we list the effects on each component; of particular note are: A new version of the declare transaction, which allows sending the new class structure The state commitment will now include contract classes Changes to the on-chain data format New system call - replace_class The deploy transaction is no longer supported on this version. Starknet Performance - Separate the state commitment computation from the execution of the transactions Add starknet-class-hash command to compute the class hash of a compiled Starknet contract Cairo: Autoformatter: Automatically break lines inside expressions This version introduces sequencer parallelization! This is the first step in our roadmap of performance upgrades. Details about the specific mechanism of parallelization and the roadmap in general are described in this medium post. A new endpoint, estimate_fee_bulk, is added to the feeder gateway. This will allow estimating the fee of several transactions at once, where each transaction is executed relative to the resulting state from applying the previous one. Sequencing performance improvements Builtin ratio changes, which affects builtin costs Add estimate_fee_bulk API that computes the fee of multiple transactions that will be executed consecutively As part of this version, we will also increase the finality of transactions in the pending block, by fixing the timestamp at the time of the block creation. This will solve the issue of transactions moving from pending to rejected on account of too old timestamp Starknet: Add DeployAccount transaction (which will replace the Deploy transaction for deploying account contracts). To use it, you should first add enough funds to your account address to pay the transaction fee, and then you can invoke DeployAccount Split the starknet deploy_account CLI command into starknet new_account and starknet deploy_account Account contracts that are expected to be deployed this way should implement the`validate_deploy()` entry point, which should check the signature of the DeployAccount transaction Improve L1 fee computation: the fee is computed according to the diff of the storage state API: Remove entry_point_type field from transaction information Cairo: Add uint256_mul_div_mod to uint256.cairo This version introduces the next step in Starknet’s account abstraction design, specifically the validate/execute separation. See here for more information. Starknet: Contract (breaking changes): @external and @view functions should be imported directly by the main compiled file. Otherwise, they will not be usable as external functions Forbid using the same storage variable name in two modules New transaction version (version 1) for invoke and declare transactions: Transactions of version 0 are deprecated and will not be supported in Starknet from the next version (v0.11.0). Please update your systems to use the new version In order to use transactions of version 1 you will need to upgrade your account contracts Add nonce field to the transactions. Nonce validation is now part of the Starknet protocol and is enforced to be executed sequentially Invoke: Split execute to two functions:` validate` (only validates the transaction) and execute (only executes the transaction) Remove the selector (which is now always execute) field, following the above change. Declare: declare transaction should now be sent from an account (and is validated using validate_declare in the account contract) Support fee for sending L1 messages. At this point, it’s not mandatory and messages with no fee will still be handled. Starting from the next version it will become mandatory. Cairo: Syntax changes in Cairo (to make it more similar to rust and C++): You can use the cairo-migrate script to convert old code to the new syntax. Use the -i flag to apply the changes to the files End statements with ; New lines are still part of the language at this point, and you cannot put more than one instruction per line. This will change in Cairo1.0. Use { … } for code blocks (instead of : and end) Add () around the condition of if statements Remove the member keyword in structs Change comment to use // instead of # Use …​, ap` instead of `...; ap in low level Cairo code Support return types that are not tuples. For example, func foo() → felt (instead of func foo() → (r: felt)) As a result, it’s now mandatory to specify return types. func foo() → (res) should be replaced by func foo() → (res: felt). The cairo-migrate tool does that automatically. Return statement accepts expressions, rather than only tuples. For example, you can write let x = (5,); return x; A few standard library functions were changed to return felt. The cairo-migrate script also fixes calls to those functions Support using functions as expressions This only applies to functions with → felt signature`, whose ap change is known at compile-time (e.g., recursive functions cannot be used this way) Fix a bug in the secp signature verification code that allowed a malicious prover to ignore the value of v (this does not let the prover fake a signature, but allows it to claim that a valid signature is invalid). Add Cairo code for the recursive STARK verifier Technical changes: * Move from python3.7 to python3.9 Starknet: API changes: Add get_block_traces API - returns all the transaction traces of a given block Add a list of declared contracts in get_state_update Add a 0x prefix for class hash in the API Add starknet_version field for blocks (only applies to new blocks) Starknet CLI: Change the default block number to pending Using a wallet is the default, --no_wallet must be specified explicitly to override this Deploying contracts: Add deploy_contract function to the account contract created by starknet deploy_account Use this function to deploy contract (unless using --no_wallet). In particular, deploy should be used after declaring the contract (it expects the contract class hash) Support --dry_run to get the transaction information without signing or sending it Support deploy_from_zero in the deploy syscall to deploy a contract to an address that does not depend on the deployer Cairo: * Support and in if statements (if x == y and z == w). At the moment other boolean combinations are not supported This version introduces the contract class/instance paradigm into Starknet. See here for more information. Starknet: Enforce fees - max_fee must not be set to zero, and selector must be execute Split the concepts of contract class and contract instance. Add declare transaction type New API and CLI commands: declare - Declares a contract class get_class_by_hash - Returns the contract class given its hash get_class_hash_at - Returns the class hash for a given contract instance address Rename delegate_call to library_call, and change the contract address argument to class hash. Add a deploy system call. Rename ContractDefinition to ContractClass Reduce the compiled contract file’s size by removing unnecessary identifiers (this optimization can be disabled using --dont_filter_identifiers) Cairo: Initial support for the EC-op builtin (scalar multiplication over the STARK curve). Not supported in Starknet yet. Add additional helper methods to blake2s.cairo, including big-endian support Technical changes: * Change function’s return type from a struct to a named tuple. In particular, foo.Return.SIZE is no longer supported.","title":"Version notes","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"version_notes","url":"/documentation/starknet_versions/version_notes/","titles":[{"text":"Starknet Environments","hash":"starknet_environments","id":1},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.1.1 (Goerli)","hash":"version0.11.1.1","id":2},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.1 (Goerli)","hash":"version0.11.1","id":3},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes","id":4},{"text":"Starknet v0.11.0 (Mar 29, 23)","hash":"version0.11.0","id":5},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_2","id":6},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.3 (Dec 12, 22)","hash":"version0.10.3","id":7},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_3","id":8},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.2 (Nov 29, 22)","hash":"version0.10.2","id":9},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_4","id":10},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.1 (Oct 25, 22)","hash":"version0.10.1","id":11},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_5","id":12},{"text":"Starknet v0.10.0 (Sept 05, 22)","hash":"version0.10.0","id":13},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_6","id":14},{"text":"Starknet v0.9.1 (July 20, 22)","hash":"version0.9.1","id":15},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_7","id":16},{"text":"Starknet v0.9.0 (June 06, 22)","hash":"version0.9.0","id":17},{"text":"Technical release notes","hash":"technical_release_notes_8","id":18}]},"8":{"id":8,"text":"In this section, you will learn to compile, deploy and interact with a Starknet contract written in Cairo.

Account address: 0x00d9d851f600d539a9f7811de4d9613a6b3c2634f8c0386a305c03216bd67559 Public key: 0x0293d6625d860b9a37a0319d1e3c1eecc27685075cbeaae4ef29ed717d93c58b Move the appropriate amount of funds to the account, and then deploy the account by invoking the 'starknet deploy_account' command. NOTE: This is a modified version of the OpenZeppelin account contract. The signature is computed differently. Next step is to fund it. Use the faucet to get some funds and send them to the account Bridge funds using Starkgate However you chose to do it, please make sure that the funding transaction reaches the \"PENDING\" status before moving on. You can look for it on Starkscan or Voyager # Deploying your account starknet deploy_account --account account_name Your sample output should look something like this: Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000568 ETH (568383605914463 WEI).

Before we get started, make sure that the below commands are working properly on your system. If they don’t, please check the Setting up your environment section. starknet --version starknet-compile --version You can now create a folder of your choice (in any location) where you would like to practice your Cairo skills . Inside the new folder, create a file name hello_starknet.cairo. #Create a new folder for practicing your cairo skills cd ~/ mkdir cairo_practice && cd cairo_practice #Create a new file called hello_starknet.cairo touch hello_starknet.cairo Copy and paste the following piece of code into your hello_starknet.cairo file: #[contract] mod HelloStarknet { use starknet::get_caller_address; use starknet::ContractAddress; #[event] fn Hello(from:ContractAddress, value:felt252) {} #[external] fn say_hello(message:felt252) { let caller=get_caller_address(); Hello(caller, message); } } Customize the above code by adding a new type of event. Find a name that is unique (this is important). Add the following code: #[event] fn My_Unique_Event_Name(from:ContractAddress, value:felt252) {} Compile the above Starknet contract using the following command: starknet-compile hello_starknet.cairo hello_starknet.json The above command should compile to produce a hello_starknet.json file in the same folder. On Starknet, the deployment process is in two steps: Declaring the class of your contract, or sending your contract’s code to the network Deploying a contract, or creating an instance of the code you previously declared Let’s start with declaring the above code. starknet declare --contract hello_starknet.json --account account_name The above command may fail if you are using code that has already been declared by someone else! Please make sure to add custom code to your contract to create a new contract class. You will see something like: Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000132 ETH (131904173791637 WEI).

Once this transaction has moved to \"PENDING\", you can deploy an instance of your contract. Using the above generated class hash, deploy the contract: starknet deploy --class_hash 0x8ceb9796d2809438d1e992b8ac17cfe83d0cf5944dbad948a370e0b5d5924f --account account_name If you run into any fee related issues, please add the flag --max_fee 100000000000000000 to your CLI commands to set an arbitrary high gas limit for your deploy transaction. You will see something like: Sending the transaction with max_fee: 0.000197 ETH (197273405375932 WEI). Invoke transaction for contract deployment was sent.

We know you are super excited and so are we! This contract is a simple read/write contract where you will learn to read and write from storage using Cairo. Our contract will be called SimpleStorage. Follow the below steps to learn to write your first Starknet contract. You can create a new folder to write this new contract or create it inside your .cairo/ folder. Let us create a new file called simple_storage.cairo. touch simple_storage.cairo You can open this empty file in your editor of choice (eg: VS Code) and start writing the below lines of code - your first Cairo contract. A Starknet contract will always start with the [#contract] macro to indicate that this is a Starknet contract. Remember that you can also create other Cairo files that are NOT contracts because Cairo is a programming language by itself. All the Cairo contracts are defined by the keyword mod which implies that it’s a module containing some logical piece of code. You can write first below lines of contract in the simple_storage.cairo file. #[contract] mod SimpleStorage {} In order to store variables on-chain, we need to create a storage structure called Storage. This struct will have all the variables that you would like to have in contract/permanent storage. Create a Storage struct within your SimpleStorage contract as shown below. struct Storage { balance: felt252 } The storage struct will always be named Storage. Yes! You read it right. Events are now supported in Cairo. You can define an event just like a function with the name of the event, in this case it is BalanceIncreased and the values you would like to emit within the bracket as arguments. //The keyword to define a function is \"fn\" #[event] fn BalanceIncreased(balance: felt252) {} Below is a simple function called increase_balance which takes in the amount as the argument of type felt252. The function is fairly simple. We read the balance variable(defined earlier in the storage struct) using ::read() function and simple increase the balance by adding the amount to it. We then write the new balance to the existing storage variable and update the value. Last but not the least, we log/emit the event with the updated balance using the name of the event function. #[external] fn increase_balance(amount: felt252) { let new_balance = balance::read() + amount; balance::write(new_balance); BalanceIncreased(new_balance); } You might have noticed a macro called external that is added to this function. This means that the function called be called externally or outside of the contract. For functions that are modifying a storage variable, you would need to add the external macro. There are other types of macros as well that you can add to a function: * event * external * view * constructor Let us see another function in the next step and the macro used. As you saw in Step 4, we are able to write to our storage using balance::write(), but how do we read from the storage? (Hint: That’s also being done in the above function). In the below function, we are reading the current balance of the storage variable balance and returning it. You can observe that we use a → symbol to return the variable, similar to Rust. This function can be a view function because it does not modify any variables. #[view] fn get_balance() -> felt252 { balance::read() } Your final contract should look something like this. #[contract] mod SimpleStorage { struct Storage { balance: felt252 } #[event] fn BalanceIncreased(balance: felt252) {} #[external] fn increase_balance(amount: felt252) { let new_balance = balance::read() + amount; balance::write(new_balance); BalanceIncreased(new_balance); } #[view] fn get_balance() -> felt252 { balance::read() } } You can now follow the steps given in the Deploying smart contracts section to compile and deploy the above contract. Congratulations on successfully writing and deploying your first Cairo contract! Once you have deployed the above contract, you would need to invoke the contract and also call the get_balance function. The call syntax has not been mentioned in the previous section but it’s fairly easy to use and that’s your challenge! If you have successfully been able to call the function and display the balance, take a screenshot and post it on Twitter, tagging us at @StarkNet.","title":"Writing your first Starknet contract","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"writing_first_contract","url":"/documentation/getting_started/writing_first_contract/","titles":[{"text":"Step 1: Contract [#macro] and modules","hash":"step_1_contract_macro_and_modules","id":1},{"text":"Step 2: Creating the Storage","hash":"step_2_creating_the_storage","id":2},{"text":"Step 3: Defining events","hash":"step_3_defining_events","id":3},{"text":"Step 4: Writing your first function","hash":"step_4_writing_your_first_function","id":4},{"text":"Step 5: Writing your view function","hash":"step_5_writing_your_view_function","id":5},{"text":"Step 6: Putting it all together","hash":"step_6_putting_it_all_together","id":6},{"text":"Quick Challenge","hash":"quick_challenge","id":7}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"A block explorer, or blockchain explorer, enables you to see transactions, blockchain metrics and other information.

Starknet’s account type is inspired by Ethereum’s EIP-4337, where instead of EOAs, you now use smart contract accounts with arbitrary verification logic. Through the use of smart contracts, you are provided with complete flexibility within your account implementation. While not mandatory at the protocol level, a richer standard interface for accounts was developed by the community. This standard was developed by OpenZeppelin, in a close collaboration with wallet teams and other Core Starknet developers. You can see the IAccount interface here. In Starknet, similar to Ethereum, every contract has a nonce. This nonce is sequential; when a transaction is sent from an account, its nonce must match the account’s nonce and it’s incremented after the transaction is executed (whether or not it was reverted). Note that, similar to Ethereum, only the nonce of account contracts (that is, those adhering to the above structure) can be non-zero. A nonce serves two important roles: It guarantees transaction hash uniqueness (this is important for good UX) It provides replay protection to the account (since the signature refers to a particular nonce, the transaction can’t be replayed by a malicious party) As seen above, Starknet currently determines the nonce structure (sequential) at the protocol level. In the future, Starknet will consider a more flexible design, extending account abstraction to nonce management (previously referred to as \"nonce abstraction\").","title":"Starknet account interface","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"approach","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/approach/","titles":[{"text":"Replay protection","hash":"replay_protection","id":1}]},"16":{"id":16,"text":"Since StarkNet version 0.10.1 the historical method of deploying accounts on StarkNet, the deploy transaction, has been removed. It has now been replaced with the deploy_account transaction which allows you to deploy an account and pay fees from a pre-funded address (thus solving the issue of how to pay fees while not yet having a deployed account). In order to deploy a new account on StarkNet you need to complete the following steps: Decide on the account contract that you want to deploy Compute your would-be account address off-chain Send funds to this address Once the address has enough funds to pay for the deployment, you can then send a deploy_account transaction. Upon receiving a deploy_account transaction, the sequencer will: Verify that the address has funds to pay for the deployment Execute the constructor with the given arguments Execute the __validate_deploy__ entry point (See below) Charge fee from the new account address Advance the nonce to 1 There are two potential issues that arise from sending a deploy_account transaction without any extra validation: Sequencers having the ability to charge arbitrarily high fees, thus potentially draining user funds from a pre-funded account A bad actor having the ability to carry out a sequencer DOS attack by sending multiple, invalid deploy_account transactions. This would result in the sequencer not being compensated for work completed. To prevent the scenario described in the first point, a new optional validation entrypoint is provided: __validate_deploy__. To prevent the potential DOS attack from the second point, we introduce some limitations on the constructor and _validate_deploy _ executions, namely: Limited # of Cairo steps Limited # of builtin applications No external contract calls (library calls and self-calls are allowed) This entrypoint should be included in any accounts or contracts that wish to allow this new deployment flow. __validate_deploy__ expects the following arguments: class hash contract address salt constructor arguments - the arguments expected by the contract’s constructor (this will be enforced in the compiler). In determining the contract address, deployer address 0 will be used. Consider an account with the following constructor signature: @constructor func constructor{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}( _public_key: felt ) Then the signature of __validate_deploy__ must be: func __validate_deploy__{ syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr, ecdsa_ptr: SignatureBuiltin* }(class_hash: felt, contract_address_salt: felt, _public_key: felt) The transaction hash and max_fee are accessible through the get_tx_info system call.","title":"Deploying new accounts","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"deploying_new_accounts","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/deploying_new_accounts/","titles":[{"text":"Deploy account transaction","hash":"deploy_account_transaction","id":1},{"text":"Transaction flow","hash":"transaction_flow","id":2},{"text":"Validate deploy","hash":"validate_deploy","id":3},{"text":"Using validate deploy","hash":"using_validate_deploy","id":4}]},"17":{"id":17,"text":"An account is a user’s representation on-chain and the way of interacting with the blockchain. Through an account, you may send transactions and interact with other contracts. To \"own\" an on-chain asset (e.g. ERC20 token or an NFT), it has to be associated with your account address. Within Ethereum individual user accounts are known as Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). EOAs differ from smart contracts in that they are not controlled by code. An EOA is determined by a pair of private and public keys. The account’s address is derived from those keys and only by possessing the private key can you initiate transactions from an account. While Ethereum contracts are \"passive\", i.e., they can only change if they were called inside a transaction, EOAs can initiate transactions. While simple, EOAs have a major drawback i.e there’s no flexibility in the account behavior, the Ethereum protocol dictates what it means for a transaction initiated by an EOA to be valid (the signature scheme is fixed). In particular, control over the private key gives complete control over the account. Although this is theoretically a secure method of account management, in practice it has some drawbacks, such as requiring you to keep your seed phrase secure yet accessible to you and limited flexibility surrounding wallet functionality. EIP-4337, a design proposal for Ethereum outlines account abstraction whereby all accounts are managed via a dedicated smart contract on the Ethereum network, as a way to increase flexibility and usability. You can add custom logic on top of the basic EOA functionality, thereby bringing account abstraction into Ethereum. The idea behind account abstraction is to allow more flexibility in the management of accounts rather than have their behavior determined at the protocol level. This can be achieved by introducing account contracts - smart contracts with programmable logic that determines the user’s account. Using account abstraction you can now program how your account functions. For example, you can: Determine what it means for a signature to be valid or what contracts your account is allowed to interact with. This is known as \"signature abstraction\" Pay transaction fees in different tokens - this is sometimes known as \"fee abstraction\" Design your own replay protection mechanism and allow sending multiple uncoupled transactions in parallel. Compare this to the sequential nonce solution used in Ethereum, which results in transactions being inherently sequential, i.e., even if you want to send two transactions in parallel, you must wait for some confirmation on the first before sending the second. Otherwise, the second transaction may be rejected due to an invalid nonce. With account abstraction, one can discuss different solutions that bypass the need for a sequential nonce. This is known as \"nonce abstraction\" Today, Starknet offers signature abstraction. In the future, we will enrich the current account abstraction design (see e.g. the paymaster proposal for fee abstraction). Two examples of how you might program an account to function using account abstraction are: Social recovery A process where if you lose your wallet, you are able to retrieve it via a selected social network, vastly improving the typical experience of wallet recovery. Operating your account via facial recognition With signature abstraction, you can use your phone’s native hardware to sign transactions, making it practically impossible to take control of another user’s account (even in the case of the phone itself being stolen).","title":"What is an account?","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"introduction","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/introduction/","titles":[{"text":"Ethereum account structure","hash":"ethereum_account_structure","id":1},{"text":"What is Account Abstraction?","hash":"account_abstraction","id":2},{"text":"Examples of customizing account functionality","hash":"examples","id":3}]},"18":{"id":18,"text":"The key stages of transaction lifetime are: The sequencer selects a transaction from the mempool and executes __validate__ If the transaction was valid, the __execute__ function is called If __execute__ ran successfully, the sequencer includes the transaction in the block, charges the fee and proceeds to work on the next transaction (once the block is concluded, it will be sent to the prover) The sequencer receives fees in ETH in return for including transactions in a block.

The __validate__ function ensures that any transaction submitted was indeed initiated by the account owner and therefore will not take up unjustified resources during the execution process. Without this mechanism, a forged transaction can result in the sequencer stealing the user’s funds. In short, __validate__ ensures that the sequencer may only include transactions that were approved by the account owner. The arbitrary logic allowed in the __validate__ function gives the account’s designer the ability to determine what it means to him for a transaction to be valid. This gives rise to the usage of different signature schemes and other exotic accounts. When the __validate__ function fails, no fee will be taken from the account in question. There are some limitations set on the __validate__ function. The purpose of these limitations is twofold: We want to avoid the sequencer having to do a lot of work only to discover that the validation failed and the sequencer is then not eligible to charge a fee (if this was possible, the sequencer would be completely exposed to DOS attacks). Validation, while now abstract and in control of the account owner rather than the protocol, should still be a simple operation. This is why in the future, Starknet will place max steps limitation upon the __validate__ function. Even if the validation is simple, we could still face the following attack: An attacker fills the mempool with transactions that are valid at time T. A sequencer may start executing them, thinking that at the time he will produce his block, they will still be valid. However, shortly after, at time T', the attacker sends one transaction that somehow invalidates all the previous ones and makes sure it’s included before the sequencer gets to publish his block (the attacker may do this by offering higher fees for this one transaction). As a concrete example, think of many __validate__ functions checking that the value of a storage slot is 1 and the attacker’s transaction later sets it to 0. To handle this issue, we add some further limitations. Currently, Starknet enforces that __validate__ does not call external contracts. The property that we achieve with the above restrictions is that a single storage update may only invalidate transactions from a single account (this is the best we can do, an account can always invalidate its own past transactions by changing its keys). Thus, the price (in fees) required to invalidate transactions in the mempool is linear in the number of unique accounts that we want to invalidate. The purpose of the __execute__ function is to abstract away the remaining actions performed by a transaction. In Ethereum, a transaction is necessarily a call to a specific function in a smart contract. With the __execute__ abstraction, the account designer controls the flow of the transaction. For example, multicalls can be natively supported in your account, saving the need to send multiple transactions (in practice, this is even harder to manage without multicalls due to nonces). A transaction is considered reverted when the __execute__ function failed. Today, reverted transactions are not included in blocks, but in the future, they will be and the sequencer will be eligible to charge a fee for the work done up to the point of failure, similar to Ethereum. Currently, the sequencer charges only for successful transactions that result from the successful completion of the __execute__ function.","title":"Validate and execute","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"validate_and_execute","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Account_Abstraction/validate_and_execute/","titles":[{"text":"The validate function","hash":"the_validate_function","id":1},{"text":"Invalid transactions","hash":"invalid_transactions","id":2},{"text":"Validate limitations","hash":"validate_limitations","id":3},{"text":"The execute function","hash":"the_execute_function","id":4},{"text":"Reverted transactions","hash":"reverted_transactions","id":5}]},"20":{"id":20,"text":"In Starknet, the block is defined as a list of transactions and a block header.

Transaction is not yet known to the sequencer Transaction was received by the sequencer. Transaction will now either execute successfully or be rejected. Transaction executed successfully and entered the pending block. Transaction executed unsuccessfully and thus was skipped (applies both to a pending and an actual created block). Possible reasons for transaction rejection: An assertion failed during the execution of the transaction (in Starknet, unlike in Ethereum, transaction executions do not always succeed). The block may be rejected on L1, thus changing the transaction status to REJECTED Transaction passed validation and entered an actual created block on L2. Transaction was accepted on-chain. Today, Starknet supports querying the new block before its construction is complete. This feature improves the responsiveness of the system prior to the decentralization phase, but will probably become obsolete once the system is decentralized, as full nodes will only propagate finalized blocks through the network. During the construction of the block, as it is accumulating new transactions, the block’s status is PENDING. While status is PENDING, new transactions are dynamically added to the block. Once the sequencer decides to close the block, it becomes ACCEPTED_ON_L2 and its hash is computed. The following example is a query for the pending mainnet block: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/get_block?blockNumber=pending See the CLI section for information on how to call the gateway with respect to the pending block.

The deploy transaction has now been removed in the current release of Starknet. To deploy new contract instances, you can use the deploy syscall. Starknet supports the transaction versions described here. When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases. Do not submit a transaction that uses an unsupported transaction type, because it cannot be included in a proof, and so cannot become part of a Starknet block.

Next, the user would submit the compilation output (the contract class) to the Starknet sequencer via a declare transaction. With Cairo 1.0, the contract class resulting from compiling Cairo 1.0 does not include Casm. Instead of Casm, it includes instructions in an intermediate representation called Sierra (Safe Intermediate Representation). This new contract class is then compiled by the sequencer, via the Sierra → Casm compiler, to generate the Cairo assembly associated with this class. Starknet is a validity rollup, which means that the execution inside every block needs to be proven, and this is where STARKs come in handy. However, STARK proofs can address statements that are formulated in the language of polynomial constraints, and have no knowledge of smart contract execution. To overcome this gap, we developed Cairo. Cairo instructions (which we referred to previously by Casm) are translated to polynomial constraints that enforce the correct execution of a program (according to the Cairo semantics defined in the paper). Thanks to Cairo, we can formulate the statement \"this Starknet block is valid\" in a way that we can prove. Note that we can only prove things about Casm. That is, regardless of what the user sends to the Starknet sequencer, what’s proven is the correct Casm execution. This means that we need a way to translate Sierra into Casm, and this is achieved with the Sierra → Casm compiler. To understand why we chose to add an additional layer between the code that the user writes (Cairo 1.0) and the code that is being proven (Casm), we need to consider more components in the system, and the limitations of Cairo. A crucial property of every decentralized L2 is that the sequencers are guaranteed to be compensated for work they do. The notion of reverted transactions is a good example: even if the user’s transaction failed mid execution, the sequencer should be able to include it in a block and charge execution fees up to the point of failure. If the sequencer cannot charge for such transactions, then sending transactions that will eventually fail (after a lot of computation steps) is an obvious DOS attack on the sequencer. The sequencer cannot look at a transaction and conclude that it would fail without actually doing the work (this is equivalent to solving the halting problem). The obvious solution to the above predicament is to include such transactions in the block, similar to Ethereum. However, this may not be as simple to do in a validity rollup. With Cairo 0, there is no separating layer between user code and what is being proven. This means that users can write code which is unprovable in some cases. In fact, such code is very easy to write, e.g. assert 0=1 is a valid Cairo instruction that cannot be proven, as it translates to polynomial constraints that are not satisfiable. Any Casm execution that contains this instruction cannot be proven. Sierra is the layer between user code and the provable statement, that allows us to make sure all transactions are eventually provable. The method by which Sierra guarantees that user code is always provable is by compiling Sierra instructions to a subset of Casm, which we call \"safe Casm\". The important property that we require from safe Casm is being provable for all inputs. A canonical example for safe Casm is using if/else instructions instead of assert, that is, making sure all failures are graceful. To better understand the considerations that go into designing the Sierra → Casm compiler, consider the find_element function from the common library of Cairo 0: func find_element{range_check_ptr}(array_ptr: felt*, elm_size, n_elms, key) -> (elm_ptr: felt*) { alloc_locals; local index; %{ ... %} assert_nn_le(a=index, b=n_elms - 1); tempvar elm_ptr = array_ptr + elm_size * index; assert [elm_ptr] = key; return (elm_ptr=elm_ptr); } Below we abuse the \"Casm\" notation by not distinguishing Cairo 0 from Casm and referring to the above as Casm (while we actually refer to the compilation result of the above). For brevity, we have omitted the hint in the above snippet, but it’s clear that this function can only execute correctly if the requested element exists in the array (otherwise it would fail for every possible hint - there is nothing we can substitute index for, that makes the following lines run successfully). Such Casm cannot be generated by the Sierra→Casm compiler. Furthermore, simply replacing the assertion with an if/else statement doesn’t do, as this results in non-deterministic execution. That is, for the same input, different hint values can yield different results. A malicious prover can use this freedom to harm the user - in this example, they are able to make it seem as if an element isn’t part of the array, even though it actually is. The safe Casm for finding an element in an array behaves like the above snippet in the happy flow (element is there): an index is given in a hint, and we verify that the array at the hinted index contains the requested element. However, in the unhappy flow (element isn’t there), we must go over the entire array to verify this. This was not the case in Cairo 0, as we were fine with certain paths not being provable (in the above snippet, the unhappy flow in which the element isn’t in the array is never provable). Sierra’s gas metering adds further complications to the above example. Even looking through the array to verify that the element isn’t there may leave some flexibility to the prover. If we take gas limitations into consideration, the user may have enough gas for the happy flow, but not for the unhappy one, making the execution stop mid-search, and allowing the prover to get away with lying about the element not being present. The way we plan to handle this is by requiring the user to have enough gas for the unhappy flow before actually calling find_element. Smart contracts written with Cairo 1.0 cannot contain user defined hints. This is already true with Cairo 0 contracts (only whitelisted hints are accepted), but with Cairo 1.0 the hints in use are determined by the Sierra → Casm compiler. Since this compilation is there to ensure that only \"safe\" Casm is generated, there is no room for hints that are not generated by the compiler. In the future, native Cairo 1.0 may contain hint syntax similar to Cairo 0, but it will not be available in Starknet smart contracts (L3s on top of Starknet may make use of such functionality). Note that this is currently not part of Starknet’s roadmap.","title":"Cairo 1.0 and Sierra","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"cairo-1-and-sierra","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Contracts/cairo-1-and-sierra/","titles":[{"text":"Why do we need Casm?","hash":"why_do_we_need_casm","id":1},{"text":"Why do we need Sierra?","hash":"why_do_we_need_sierra","id":2},{"text":"Reverted transactions, unsatisfiable AIRs, and DOS attacks","hash":"reverted_transactions_unsatisfiable_airs_and_dos_attacks","id":3},{"text":"Safe Casm","hash":"safe_casm","id":4},{"text":"Hints in Cairo 1.0","hash":"hints_in_cairo_1_0","id":5}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"The class hash is a hash chain of the definition of the class.

A contract class is the definition of the contract: Cairo byte code, hint information, entry point names, and everything that defines its semantics unambiguously. Each class is identified by its class hash, which is analogous to a class name in an object-oriented programming language. A contract instance is a deployed contract corresponding to a class. Notice that only contract instances behave as contracts in that they have their own storage and can be called by transactions or other contracts. A contract class does not necessarily have a deployed instance in Starknet. New classes can be added to the state of Starknet with the declare transaction. New instances of a previously declared class can be deployed via the deploy system call. To use the functionality of a declared class, without deploying an instance of that class, you can use the library_call system call. This system call is an analogue of Ethereum’s delegate call in the world of classes. You can use class code directly, instead of having a placeholder contract deployed, which is used only for its code.","title":"Contract Classes","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"contract-classes","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Contracts/contract-classes/","titles":[{"text":"Using Classes","hash":"using_classes","id":1}]},"28":{"id":28,"text":"The contract’s storage is a persistent storage space where you can read, write, modify, and persist data. The storage is a map with \\(2^{251}\\) slots, where each slot is a felt which is initialized to 0. The basic function for writing to storage writes value to key is: Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 storage_write(key, value); storage_write_syscall(address_domain, address, value) Both are system calls that can be imported by adding the line: Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 from starkware.starknet.common.syscalls import storage_read, storage_write use starknet::syscalls::storage_read_syscall; use starknet::syscalls::storage_write_syscall; Another basic function is used for getting the storage address, this function is created by the compiler when defining a storage variable, as explained below. This function returns the address of the storage variable. Below we discuss how this address is determined from the variable’s name and keys. The most common way for interacting with a contract’s storage is through storage variables. The @storage_var decorator declares a variable that will be kept as part of the contract storage. The variable can consist of a single felt, or it can be a mapping from multiple arguments to a tuple of felts or structs. To use this variable, the var.read(args), var.write(args, value) and var.addr(args) functions are automatically created by the @storage_var decorator, for reading the storage value, writing the storage value and getting the storage address, respectively. The Starknet contract compiler generates the Cairo code that maps the storage variable’s name and argument values to an address — so that it can be part of the generated proof. The address of a storage variable is computed as follows: If it is a single value, then the address is sn_keccak(variable_name), where variable_name is the ASCII encoding of the variable’s name. If it is a (nested) mapping, then the address of the value at key k_1,...,k_n is h(...h(h(sn_keccak(variable_name),k_1),k_2),...,k_n) where \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash and the final value is taken \\(\\bmod 2^{251}-256\\) If it is a mapping to complex values (e.g., tuples or structs), then this complex value lies in a continuous segment starting from the address calculated in the previous point. Note that 256 field elements is the current limitation on the maximal size of a complex storage value. Note that when calling var.addr(args) for a storage variable with complex values, the returned value is the address of the first element in the storage. We can summarize the above as follows: storage variable address := pedersen(keccak(variable name), keys) In the following example we define a storage variables with complex values.

However, Cairo is a general purpose language that you can use for much more than just contract language. For details, see Cairo – a Turing-complete STARK-friendly CPU architecture. So writing smart contracts requires some operations, such as calling another contract or accessing the contract’s storage, that standalone programs do not require. The Starknet contract language supports these operations by using system calls. System calls enable a contract to require services from the Starknet OS. You can use system calls in a function to get information that depends on the broader state of Starknet, which would otherwise be inaccessible, rather than local variables that appear in the function’s scope. Below we describe the collection of system calls that can be used to get information regarding the block, transaction or execution context during runtime (e.g. block number, account address, and caller address). func get_block_number{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (block_number : felt) Description Gets the number of the block in which the transaction is executed. Arguments None. Return values block_number The number of the block in which the transaction is executed. Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func get_block_timestamp{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (block_timestamp : felt) Description Gets the timestamp of the block in which the transaction is executed. Arguments None. Return values 'block_timestamp' The timestamp of the block in which the transaction is executed Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func get_caller_address{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (caller_address : felt) Description Returns the address of the calling contract, or 0 if the call was not initiated by another contract. Arguments None. Return values caller_address The address of the calling contract, or 0 if the call was not initiated by another contract. Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func get_contract_address{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (contract_address : felt) Description Gets the address of the contract who raised the system call. Arguments None. Return values contract_address The address of the contract who raised the system call. Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func get_sequencer_address{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (sequencer_address : felt) Description Returns the address of the sequencer that generated the current block. Arguments None. Return values sequencer_address The address of the sequencer that generated the current block. Common library syscalls.cairo Gets information about the original transaction. Syntax func get_tx_info{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (tx_info : TxInfo*) Description Gets information about the original transaction. Arguments None. Return values tx_info The following information about the original transaction: the version of the transaction the address of the account that initiated this transaction the maximum fee that is allowed to be charged for the inclusion of this transaction the signature of the account that initiated this transaction the transaction’s hash the intended chain id Common library syscalls.cairo Description Calls a given contract. This system call expects the address of the called contract, a selector for a function within that contract, and call arguments. Syntax func call_contract{syscall_ptr : felt*}( contract_address : felt, function_selector : felt, calldata_size : felt, calldata : felt* ) -> (retdata_size : felt, retdata : felt*) Arguments contract_address The address of the contract you want to call. function_selector A selector for a function within that contract. calldata_size The size, in number of felts, of the calldata. calldata The calldata. Return values retdata_size The size, in number of felts, of the return data. retdata The return data. Common library syscalls.cairo This is considered a lower level syntax for calling contracts. If the interface of the called contract is available, then you can use a more straightforward syntax. Syntax func deploy{syscall_ptr : felt*}( class_hash : felt, contract_address_salt : felt, constructor_calldata_size : felt, constructor_calldata : felt*, deploy_from_zero: felt, ) -> (contract_address : felt) Description Deploys a new instance of a previously declared class. Arguments class_hash The class hash of the contract to be deployed contract_address_salt The salt, an arbitrary value provided by the sender, used in the computation of the contract’s address. constructor_calldata_size The number of arguments to pass to the constructor, equal to the number of felts in constructor_calldata. constructor_calldata The constructor’s calldata. An array of felts. deploy_from_zero A flag used for the contract address computation. If not set, the caller address will be used as the new contract’s deployer address, otherwise 0 is used. Return values contract_address The address of the deployed contract. Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func emit_event{syscall_ptr : felt*}(keys_len : felt, keys : felt*, data_len : felt, data : felt*) Description Emits an event with a given set of keys and data. For more information, and for a higher level syntax for emitting events, see Starknet events. Arguments keys_len The number of keys in the event. Analogous to Ethereum’s event topics, you can use the starknet_getEvents method to filter by these keys. keys The event’s keys data_len The number of data elements in the event. data The event’s data Return values None. Common library syscalls.cairo Example The following example emits an event with two keys, the strings status and deposit and three data elements: 1, 2, and 3. let (keys : felt*) = alloc() assert keys[0] = 'status' assert keys[1] = 'deposit' let (data : felt*) = alloc() assert data[0] = 1 assert data[1] = 2 assert data[2] = 3 emit_event(2, keys, 3, data) Syntax func library_call{syscall_ptr : felt*}( class_hash : felt, function_selector : felt, calldata_size : felt, calldata : felt* ) -> (retdata_size : felt, retdata : felt*) Description Calls the requested function in any previously declared class. This system call replaces the known delegate call functionality from Ethereum, with the important difference that there is only one contract involved. The class is only used for its logic. Arguments class_hash The hash of the class you want to use. function_selector A selector for a function within that class. calldata_size The size, in number of felts, of the calldata. calldata The calldata. Return values retdata_size The size, in number of felts, of the return data. retdata The return data. Common library syscalls.cairo This system call is not currently not supported in Cairo 1.0. In practice, this was only used for proxy contracts, which in Cairo 1.0 can be implemented instead via the replace_class system call, making library_call_l1_handler redundant. Syntax func library_call_l1_handler{syscall_ptr : felt*}( class_hash : felt, function_selector : felt, calldata_size : felt, calldata : felt* ) -> (retdata_size : felt, retdata : felt*) Description Calls the requested L1 handler in any previously declared class. Same as the library_call system call, but also enables you to call an L1 handler that cannot otherwise be called directly. For more information, see Starknet’s messaging mechanism. When you invoke an L1 handler with this system call, the sequencer does not consume an L1→L2 message. This system call enables an L1 handler to use the logic inside an L1 handler in a different class. It is recommended to raise this system call only inside an L1 handler. Arguments class_hash The hash of the class you want to use. function_selector A selector for an L1 handler function within that class. calldata_size The size, in number of felts, of the calldata. calldata The calldata. Return values retdata_size The size, in number of felts, of the return data. retdata The return data. Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func send_message_to_l1{syscall_ptr : felt*}( to_address : felt, payload_size : felt, payload : felt* ) Description Sends a message to L1. This system call includes the message parameters as part of the proof’s output, and exposes these parameters to the Starknet Core contract on L1 once the state update, including the transaction, is received. For more information, see Starknet’s messaging mechanism. Arguments to_address The recipient’s L1 address. payload_size The size of the message payload. payload A pointer to an array containing the contents of the message. Return values None.

After calling replace_class, the code currently executing from the old class will finish running. The new class will be used from the next transaction onwards or if the contract is called via the call_contract syscall in the same transaction (after the replacement). Arguments class_hash The hash of the class you want to use as a replacement. Return values None Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func storage_read{syscall_ptr : felt*}(address : felt) -> (value : felt) Description Gets the value of a key in the storage of the calling contract. This system call provides direct access to any possible key in storage, in contrast with balance.read(), which enables you to read storage variables that are defined explicitly in the contract. For information on accessing storage by using the storage variables, see storage variables. Arguments address The address of the storage key you want to read. Return values value The value of the key. Common library syscalls.cairo Example let value = storage_read(3534535754756246375475423547453) Sets the value of a key in the storage of the calling contract. Syntax func storage_write{syscall_ptr : felt*}(address : felt, value : felt) Description Sets the value of a key in the storage of the calling contract. This system call provides direct access to any possible key in storage, in contrast with balance.write(), which enables you to write to storage variables that are defined explicitly in the contract. For information on accessing storage by using the storage variables, see storage variables. Arguments address The address of the storage key to which you want to write. .value The value to write to the key. Return values None.

However, Cairo is a general purpose language that you can use for much more than just contract language. For details, see Cairo – a Turing-complete STARK-friendly CPU architecture. So writing smart contracts requires some operations, such as calling another contract or accessing the contract’s storage, that standalone programs do not require. The Starknet contract language supports these operations by using system calls. System calls enable a contract to require services from the Starknet OS. You can use system calls in a function to get information that depends on the broader state of Starknet, which would otherwise be inaccessible, rather than local variables that appear in the function’s scope. Below we describe the collection of system calls that can be used to get information regarding the block, transaction or execution context during runtime (e.g. block number, account address, and caller address). func get_block_number{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (block_number : felt) Description Gets the number of the block in which the transaction is executed. Arguments None. Return values block_number The number of the block in which the transaction is executed. Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func get_block_timestamp{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (block_timestamp : felt) Description Gets the timestamp of the block in which the transaction is executed. Arguments None. Return values 'block_timestamp' The timestamp of the block in which the transaction is executed Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func get_caller_address{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (caller_address : felt) Description Returns the address of the calling contract, or 0 if the call was not initiated by another contract. Arguments None. Return values caller_address The address of the calling contract, or 0 if the call was not initiated by another contract. Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func get_contract_address{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (contract_address : felt) Description Gets the address of the contract who raised the system call. Arguments None. Return values contract_address The address of the contract who raised the system call. Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax func get_sequencer_address{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (sequencer_address : felt) Description Returns the address of the sequencer that generated the current block. Arguments None. Return values sequencer_address The address of the sequencer that generated the current block. Common library syscalls.cairo ===get_transaction_info Gets information about the original transaction. Syntax func get_tx_info{syscall_ptr : felt*}() -> (tx_info : TxInfo*) Description Gets information about the original transaction. Arguments None. Return values tx_info The following information about the original transaction: the version of the transaction the address of the account that initiated this transaction the maximum fee that is allowed to be charged for the inclusion of this transaction the signature of the account that initiated this transaction the transaction’s hash the intended chain id Common library syscalls.cairo In Cairo 1.0, all block/transaction/execution context getters are batched into a single system call: get_execution_info. Syntax extern fn get_execution_info_syscall() -> SyscallResult> implicits( GasBuiltin, System ) nopanic; Description Gets information about the original transaction. Arguments None. Return values ExecutionInfo A struct containing the execution info Description Calls a given contract.

For more information, and for a higher level syntax for emitting events, see Starknet events. Arguments keys_len The number of keys in the event. Analogous to Ethereum’s event topics, you can use the starknet_getEvents method to filter by these keys. keys The event’s keys data_len The number of data elements in the event. data The event’s data Return values None.

Syntax func library_call_l1_handler{syscall_ptr : felt*}( class_hash : felt, function_selector : felt, calldata_size : felt, calldata : felt* ) -> (retdata_size : felt, retdata : felt*) Description Calls the requested L1 handler in any previously declared class. Same as the library_call system call, but also enables you to call an L1 handler that cannot otherwise be called directly. For more information, see Starknet’s messaging mechanism. When you invoke an L1 handler with this system call, the sequencer does not consume an L1→L2 message. This system call enables an L1 handler to use the logic inside an L1 handler in a different class. It is recommended to raise this system call only inside an L1 handler. Arguments class_hash The hash of the class you want to use. function_selector A selector for an L1 handler function within that class. calldata_size The size, in number of felts, of the calldata. calldata The calldata. Return values retdata_size The size, in number of felts, of the return data. retdata The return data.

This system call includes the message parameters as part of the proof’s output, and exposes these parameters to the Starknet Core contract on L1 once the state update, including the transaction, is received. For more information, see Starknet’s messaging mechanism. Arguments to_address The recipient’s L1 address. payload_size The size of the message payload. payload A pointer to an array containing the contents of the message. Return values None.

Cairo 0 Cairo 1 let payload = alloc() payload[0] = 1 payload[1] = 2 send_message_to_l1(3423542542364363,2,payload) let payload = ArrayTrait::new(); payload.append(1); payload.append(2); send_message_to_l1_syscall(payload).unwrap_syscall(); Syntax Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 replace_class(class_hash: felt) extern fn replace_class_syscall( class_hash: ClassHash ) -> SyscallResult implicits(GasBuiltin, System) nopanic; Description Once replace_class is called, the class of the calling contract (i.e. the contract whose address is returned by get_contract_address at the time the syscall is called) will be replaced by the class whose hash is given by the class_hash argument . After calling replace_class, the code currently executing from the old class will finish running. The new class will be used from the next transaction onwards or if the contract is called via the call_contract syscall in the same transaction (after the replacement). Arguments class_hash The hash of the class you want to use as a replacement. Return values None Common library syscalls.cairo Syntax Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 func storage_read{syscall_ptr : felt*}(address : felt) -> (value : felt) extern fn storage_read_syscall( address_domain: u32, address: StorageAddress, ) -> SyscallResult implicits(GasBuiltin, System) nopanic; Description Gets the value of a key in the storage of the calling contract. This system call provides direct access to any possible key in storage, in contrast with balance.read(), which enables you to read storage variables that are defined explicitly in the contract. For information on accessing storage by using the storage variables, see storage variables. Arguments address The address of the storage key you want to read. Return values value The value of the key. Common library syscalls.cairo Example Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 let value = storage_read(3534535754756246375475423547453) use starknet::storage_access::storage_base_address_from_felt252; ... let storage_address = storage_base_address_from_felt252(3534535754756246375475423547453) storage_read_syscall(0, storage_address).unwrap_syscall() Sets the value of a key in the storage of the calling contract. Syntax Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 func storage_write{syscall_ptr : felt*}(address : felt, value : felt) extern fn storage_write_syscall( address_domain: u32, address: StorageAddress, value: felt252 ) -> SyscallResult implicits(GasBuiltin, System) nopanic; Description Sets the value of a key in the storage of the calling contract. This system call provides direct access to any possible key in storage, in contrast with balance.write(), which enables you to write to storage variables that are defined explicitly in the contract. For information on accessing storage by using the storage variables, see storage variables. Arguments address The address of the storage key to which you want to write. .value The value to write to the key. Return values None.

This means that upon the acceptance of a state update on-chain, the state diff between the previous and new state is sent as calldata to Ethereum. This data allows anyone that observes Ethereum to reconstruct the current state of Starknet. To update the Starknet state on L1, it suffices to send a valid proof — without information on the transactions or particular changes that this update caused. Consequently, more information must be provided in order to allow other parties to locally track Starknet’s state. The state diffs contain information on every contract whose storage was updated and additional information on contract deployments. Those differences are sent as uint256[] array as part of the calldata, and are encoded as follows: Number of cells that encode contract deployments For each deployed contract, we have: contract_address - the address of the deployed contract contract_hash - the hash of the class Number of contracts whose storage is updated For each such contract, we have: contract_address - the address of the contract num_of_storage_updates - number of storage updates `nonce, num_of_storage_updates ` - a uint256 value that encodes both the number of storage updates for that contract and the updated nonce: \\[\\underbrace{0\\cdots0}_{\\text{128 bits}} | \\underbrace{\\text{new nonce}}_{\\text{64 bits}} | {\\underbrace{\\text{# of storage updates}}_{\\text{64 bits}}}_{\\text{LSB}}\\] For each storage update: key - the address inside the contract’s storage where the value is updated value - the new value Below we show an example of on chain data which was extracted from L1, and proceed to decode it according to the above format.

Each event contains the following fields: from_address: address of the contract emitting the events keys: a list of field elements data: a list of field elements The keys can be used for indexing the events, while the data may contain any information that we wish to log (note that we are dealing with two separate lists of possibly varying size, rather than a list of key-value pairs). Events can be defined in a contract using the @event decorator. Once an event E has been defined, the compiler automatically adds the function E.emit(). The following example illustrates how an event is defined and emitted: Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 @event func message_received(a : felt, b: felt): end #[event] fn Transfer(from: ContractAddress, to: ContractAddress, value: u256) {} Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 message_received.emit(1, 2); Transfer(12345, 12345, 1) The emit function emits an event with a single key, which is an identifier of the event, given by \\(\\text{sn_keccak(event_name)}\\), where \\(\\text{event_name}\\) is the ASCII encoding of the event’s name and \\(\\text{sn_keccak}\\) is defined here. To emit custom keys, one should use the low level emit_event system call: Cairo 0 Cairo 1.0 from starkware.starknet.common.syscalls import emit_event # ... let (keys : felt*) = alloc() assert keys[0] = 'status' assert keys[1] = 'deposit' let (data : felt*) = alloc() assert data[0] = 1 assert data[1] = 2 assert data[2] = 3 emit_event(2, keys, 3, data) use starknet::syscalls::emit_event_syscall; let keys = ArrayTrait::new(); keys.append('key'); keys.append('deposit'); let values = ArrayTrait::new(); values.append(1); values.append(2); values.append(3); emit_event_syscall(keys, values).unwrap_syscall(); The above code emits an event with two keys, the strings \"status\" and \"deposit\" (think of those as identifiers of the event that can be used for indexing) and three data elments 1, 2, 3. When using the higher level emit syntax, the event’s data may be of complex types, for example: struct Point: member x : felt member y : felt end @event func message_received(arr_len : felt, arr: felt*, p: Point): end # ... let (data : felt*) = alloc() assert data[0] = 1 assert data[1] = 2 let p = Point(3,4) message_received.emit(2, data, p) The emitted events are part of the transaction receipt. The event definition appears in the contract’s ABI. It contains the list of data fields (name and type) and the list of the custom keys (that is, all keys except the event identifier discussed above).

If you want to skip the motivation and deep dive into the mechanism, you can skip directly to the final formula. This section focuses on fees paid by an account on L2. For information about messaging fees that are paid on L1, see L1 → L2 message fees. Users can specify the maximum fee that they are willing to pay for a transaction via the max_fee field. The only limitation on the sequencer (enforced by the Starknet OS) is that the actual fee charged is bounded by max_fee, but for now, StarkWare’s sequencer will only charge the fee required to cover the proof cost (potentially less than the max fee). Presently, the sequencer only takes into account L1 costs involving proof submission. There are two components affecting the L1 footprint of a transaction: computational complexity: the heavier the transaction, the larger its portion in the proof verification cost. on chain data: L1 calldata cost originating from data availability and L2→L1 messages. The fee is denominated in ETH (this may change in future versions). Each transaction is associated with a gas estimate (explained below), and combining this with the gas price yields the estimated fee. Let’s analyze the correct metric for measuring transaction complexity. For simplicity, we will ignore Cairo’s builtins for the sake of the explanation, then see later how to refer to them. Recall that a Cairo program execution yields an execution trace. When proving a Starknet block, we aggregate all the transactions appearing in that block to the execution trace. Starknet’s prover generates proofs for execution traces, up to some maximal length \\(L\\) (Derived from the specs of the proving machine and the desired proof latency). Tracking the execution trace length associated with each transaction is simple. Each assertion over field elements (such as verifying addition/multiplication over the field) requires the same, constant number of trace cells (this is where our “no-builtins” assumption kicks in! Obviously Pedersen occupies more trace cells than addition). Therefore, in a world without builtins, the fee of the transaction is correlated with \\(\\text{TraceCells}[tx]/L\\). The Cairo execution trace is separated — and each builtin has its own slot. We have to mind this slot allocation when determining the fee. Let’s go over a concrete example first. For example, imagine the following trace that the prover will occupy: (up to) 500,000,000 Cairo Steps (up to) 20,000,000 Pedersen hashes (up to) 4,000,000 signature verifications (up to) 10,000,000 range checks The proof will be closed and sent to L1 when any of these components becomes full. It’s important to realize that the division to builtins must be predetermined! We can’t decide on the fly to have proof with 20,000,001 Pedersen and nothing else. Suppose, for example, that a transaction uses 10,000 Cairo steps and 500 Pedersen hashes. We can squeeze at most 40,000 such transactions into our hypothetical trace (20,000,000/500). Therefore, its gas price will be correlated with 1/40,000 the cost of submitting proof. Notice we completely ignored the number of Cairo steps this transaction performance estimation, as it is not the limiting factor (since 500,000,000/10,000 > 20,000,000/500). With this example in mind, we can now formulate the exact fee associated with L2 computation. For each transaction, the sequencer calculates a vector CairoResourceUsage holding: Number of Cairo steps Number of applications of each Cairo builtin (e.g., five range checks and two Pedersens) The sequencer crosses this information with the CairoResourceFeeWeights vector. For each resource type (step or a specific builtin application), CairoResourceFeeWeights has an entry that specifies the relative gas cost of that component in the proof. Going back to the above example, if the cost of submitting a proof with 20,000,000 Pedersen hashes is roughly 5m gas, then the weight of the Pedersen builtin is 0.25 gas per application (5,000,000/20,000,000). The sequencer has a pre-defined weights vector, in accordance with the proof parameters. The sequencer will charge only according to the limiting factor! Therefore the fee is correlated with: \\[\\max_k[\\text{CairoResourceUsage}_k \\cdot \\text{CairoResourceFeeWeights}_k]\\] Where \\(k\\) here enumerates the Cairo resource components, namely: number of steps and built-ins used. The weights are: Cairo step Pedersen Poseidon Range check ECDSA Bitwise EC_OP 0.01 gas/step 0.32 gas/application 0.32 gas/application 0.16 gas/application 20.48 gas/application 0.64 gas/application 10.24 gas/application The on-chain data associated with a transaction is composed of three parts storage updates l2→l1 messages deployed contracts Whenever a transaction updates a key at the storage of some contract, the following 32 byte words reach L1 as calldata: contract_address number of updated keys in that contract key to update new value Note that only the most recent value reaches L1. That is, the transaction’s fee only depends on the number of unique storage updates (if the same storage cell is updated multiple times within the transaction, the fee remains that of a single update). For more information, see the exact format. Let \\(c_w\\) denote the L1 calldata cost of a 32 byte word, measured in gas. With 16 gas per byte we have \\(c_w=16\\cdot 32=512\\). Consequently, the associated storage update fee for a transaction updating \\(n\\) unique contracts and \\(m\\) unique keys is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot c_w\\cdot\\underbrace{(2n+2m)}_{\\text{number of words}}\\] Note that there are many possible improvements to the above pessimistic estimation that will be gradually presented in future versions of Starknet. For example, if different transactions within the same block update the same storage cell, there is no need to charge both of them (only the latest value reaches L1). In the future, Starknet may include a refund mechanism for such cases. When a transaction which raises the send_message_to_l1 syscall is included in a state update, the following data reaches L1: l2 sender address l1 destination address payload size payload (list of field elements) Consequently, the fee associated with a single l2→l1 message is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot c_w\\cdot(3+\\text{payload_size})\\] When a transactions which raises the deploy syscall is included in a state update, the following data reaches L1: contract addresss class hash Consequently, the fee associated with a single deployment is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot 2 c_w\\] The fee for a transaction with: Cairo usage represented by the vector \\(v\\) (the entries of \\(v\\) correspond to the number of steps and number of applications per builtin) \\(n\\) unique contract updates \\(m\\) unique key updates \\(t\\) messages with payload sizes \\(q_1,...,q_t\\) \\(\\ell\\) contract deployments is given by: \\[F = \\text{gas_price}\\cdot\\left(\\max_k v_k w_k + c_w\\left(2(n+m) + 3t + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^t q_i + 2\\ell\\right)\\right)\\] where \\(w\\) is the weights vector discussed above and \\(c_w\\) is the calldata cost (in gas) per 32 byte word. The fee is charged atomically with the transaction execution on L2. The Starknet OS injects a transfer of the fee-related ERC-20, with an amount equal to the fee paid, sender equals to the transaction submitter, and the sequencer as a receiver.","title":"Fee Mechanism","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"fee-mechanism","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Fees/fee-mechanism/","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":1},{"text":"Fee Units","hash":"fee_units","id":2},{"text":"How much fee is charged?

During the execution of a Starknet transaction, a contract on Starknet sends an L2→L1 message by calling the send_message_to_L1 syscall. The message parameters (which contain the recipient contract on L1 and the relevant data) are then attached to the relevant state update that includes this syscall invocation. For example: let (message_payload : felt*) = alloc() assert message_payload[0] = // potentially add more elements to message_payload (message_payload[1], message_payload[2], etc.) assert_lt_felt(to_address, ETH_ADDRESS_BOUND) assert_not_zero(to_address) send_message_to_l1(to_address=to_address, payload_size=1, payload=message_payload) After the state update that included this transaction is proved and the L1 state is updated, the message is stored on L1 in the Starknet Core Contract (and the relevant counter is increased), and the LogMessageToL1 event (which contains the message parameters) is emitted. Later, the recipient address on L1 can access and consume the message as part of an L1 transaction by re-supplying the message parameters. This is done by calling consumeMessageFromL2 in the Starknet Core Contract, who verifies that the hash corresponds to a stored message and that the caller is indeed the recipient on L1. In such a case, the reference count of the message hash in the Starknet Core Contract decreases by 1. The above flow is illustrated in the following diagram: As demonstrated above, the structure of an L2 → L1 message is given by: Table 1. L2 → L1 Message FromAddress ToAddress Payload FieldElement EthereumAddress Payload The hash of an L2 → L1 message is computed on L1 as follows: keccak256( abi.encodePacked( FromAddress, ToAddress, Payload.length, Payload ) ); As the hash of the message being sent needs to be written to L1 storage (in the Starknet Core contract) there is always a fixed 20k gas cost associated with sending an L2 to L1 message. Contracts on L1 can interact asynchronously with contracts on L2 via the L1→L2 messaging protocol. The protocol consists of the following stages: 1. An L1 contract initiates a message to an L2 contract on Starknet. It does so by calling the sendMessageToL2 function on the Starknet Core Contract with the message parameters. 1.1 The Starknet Core Contract hashes the message parameters and updates the L1→L2 message mapping to indicate that a message with this hash was indeed sent. In fact, the L1 contract records the fee that the sender paid. For more information, see L1 → L2 message fees. 2. The message is then decoded into a Starknet transaction that invokes a function annotated with the l1_handler decorator on the target contract. Transactions like this on L2 are called L1 handler transactions. 2.1. The Starknet sequencer, upon seeing enough L1 confirmations for the transaction that sent the message, initiates the corresponding L2 transaction. 2.2. The L2 transaction invokes the relevant l1_handler. 3. The L1 Handler transaction that was created in the previous step is added to a proof. 4. The state update is received on the Core contract 5. the message is cleared from the Core contract’s storage. At this point the message is handled. The above flow is illustrated in the following diagram: An L1→L2 message consists of: The L1 sender address The recipient contract address on Starknet Function selector Calldata array Message nonce Message nonce The message nonce is maintained on the Starknet Core contract on L1, and is bumped whenever a message is sent to L2. It is used to avoid hash collisions between different L1 handler transactions who are induced by the same message being sent on L1 multiple times (see below). Imagine a scenario where a user transfers an asset from L1 to L2. The flow starts with the user sending the asset to a Starknet bridge and the corresponding L1→L2 message generation. Now, imagine that the L2 message consumption doesn’t function (this might happen due to a bug in the dApps’s Cairo contract). This could result in the user losing custody over their asset forever. To mitigate this risk, we allow the contract that initiated the L1→L2 message to cancel it — after declaring the intent and waiting a suitable amount of time. The user starts by calling startL1ToL2MessageCancellation with the relevant message parameters in the Starknet Core Contract. Then, after a five days delay, the user can finalize the cancellation by calling cancelL1ToL2Message. The reason for the delay is to protect the sequencer from a DOS attack in the form of repeatedly sending and canceling a message — before it is included in L1, rendering the L2 block which contains the activation of the corresponding L1 handler invalid. Note that this flow should only be used in edge cases such as bugs on the Layer 2 contract preventing message consumption. An L1 → L2 message induces a transaction on L2, which, unlike regular transactions, is not sent by an account. This calls for a different mechanism for paying the transaction’s fee, for otherwise the sequencer has no incentive of including L1 handler transactions inside a block. To avoid having to interact with both L1 and L2 when sending a message, L1 → L2 messages are payable on L1, by sending ETH with the call to the payable function sendMessageToL2 on the Starknet Core contract. The sequencer takes this fee in exchange for handling the message. The sequencer charges the fee in full upon updating the L1 state with the consumption of this message. The fee itself is calculated in the same manner as \"regular\" L2 transactions. You can use the CLI to get an estimate of an L1 → L2 message fee. For completeness, we describe the precise structure of both the message as it appears on L1 and the induced transaction as it appears on L2. Table 2. L1 → L2 Message FromAddress ToAddress Selector Payload Nonce EthereumAddress FieldElement FieldElement List FieldElement The hash of the message is computed on L1 as follows: keccak256( abi.encodePacked( uint256(FromAddress), ToAddress, Nonce, Selector, Payload.length, Payload ) ); Table 3.

Each supported token is associated with an L1 and L2 bridge contracts that are communicating via Starknet’s messaging mechanism. The bridges facilitate a user’s ability to conduct their transactions with their ETH and ERC-20 tokens that reside on L1, via the Starknet Alpha network and its STARK-based computational compression capabilities. For simplicity, we use terms such as “deposit”, “transact”, and “transfer” to refer to various operations involving a bridge, even though ETH and ERC20 tokens never actually leave Ethereum. The user calls the function deposit (see ERC-20 deposit and ETH deposit), supplying as parameters the recipient address on Starknet and the amount to transfer in the case of ERC-20 token. The deposit function then: Checks that the funds transferred are within the Alpha limitations Transfers the funds from the user account to the Starknet bridge Emits a deposit event with the sender address on L1, the recipient address on L2, and the amount Sends a message to the relevant L2 bridge with the amount to be transferred, and the recipient address as parameters. Note that, since every single bridge is dedicated to one token type, the token type doesn’t have to be explicit here. At the end of this step (i.e., after the execution on L1) the deposit transaction is known to Starknet’s sequencer, yet sequencers may wait for enough L1 confirmations before corresponding deposit transaction is initated on L2. During this step, the status of the L2 deposit transaction is NOT_RECEIVED. Once enough block confirmations are received for step 1, the sequencers may refer to the deposit request by triggering the L1 handler \"` handle_deposit on the L2 bridge. The function handle_deposit verifies that the deposit indeed came from the corresponding L1 bridge. It then calls to the relevant ERC-20 contract (e.g. the ERC-20 representing ETH on Starknet) and mints the tokens for the user. At the end of this step (i.e., after the sequencer processed this transaction, but before a proof is generated), the status of the deposit request will be ACCEPTED_ON_L2. Once the sequencer completes the block construction, Starknet’s provers will prove its validity and submit a state update to L1. When this happens, the message confirming the funds transfer will be cleared from the Starknet Core Contract, and the fact that the user has transferred their funds will be part of the now finalized state of Starknet. Note that if the message wasn’t on L1 to begin with (meaning Starknet “invented” a deposit request), the state update would fail. To initiate a withdraw, a user calls the initiate_withdraw function on the L2 bridge contract, supplying as parameters the recipient address on Ethereum, as well as the amount to transfer. The withdraw function then: Burns the transferred amount of tokens from the balance of the withdrawal’s initiator Sends a message to the relevant L1 bridge with the amount to be transferred, and the recipient address as parameters. As before, since the bridges are token-specific, the token itself is implicit here. Once the sequencer completes the block construction, Starknet’s provers will prove the validity of the block and submit a state update to L1. When this happens, the message from the previous step is stored in the Starknet Core Contract. After the withdraw message has been recorded on the Starknet Core Contract, anyone can finalize the transfer on L1 from the bridge back to the user, by calling the withdraw function (see ERC-20 withdraw and ETH withdraw). This step is permissionless, and may be performed by anyone. Since the user’s address is part of the recorded message on L1, he will be the recepient of the funds, regardless of who called the withdraw function on L1.

When a transaction is sent to a given contract, the transaction’s nonce must match the nonce of the contract. After the transaction is executed, the contract’s nonce is increased by one. Note that while on Ethereum, only EOAs can send transactions and consequently have a non-zero nonce, on Starknet, only account contracts can send transactions and have a non-zero nonce. With the above definition, we can provide a brief sketch of Starknet’s transition function.

Today, the user signs the compiled_class_hash as part of a declare v2 transaction. If the transaction was included in a block, then this compiled_class_hash becomes part of the commitment. In the future, when Sierra→Casm compilation becomes part of the Starknet OS, this value may be updated via a proof of the Sierra→Casm compiler execution, showing that compiling the same class with a newer compiler version results in some new compiled class hash. As mentioned above, our commitment scheme uses a binary Merkle-Patricia tree with the Pedersen hash function. Each node in the tree is represented by a triplet \\((length, path, bottom)\\). The actual data is placed in the leaves, and a leaf node with data \\(x\\) is encoded by the triplet \\((0,0,x)\\). Empty nodes (leaves or internal) are encoded by the zero triplet \\((0,0,0)\\). A subtree rooted at a node \\((length, path, bottom)\\) has a single non-empty subtree, rooted at the node obtained by following the path specified by \\(path\\). \\(path\\) is an integer in \\([0, 2^{length}-1]\\), and the binary expansion of \\(path\\) indicates how should we proceed along the tree, where the first step is indicated by the most significant bit, and \\(0,1\\) are interpreted as left, right correspondingly. Note that the reason that length is specified and cannot be deduced from \\(path\\) is that we’re dealing with field elements of fixed size (251 bits each). For a node with \\(length>0\\), following \\(path\\) leads the highest node whose both right and left child are none empty. The following rules specify how the tree is constructed from a given set of leaves: The hash of a node \\(N =(length, path, bottom)\\), denoted by \\(H(N)\\), is: \\[H(N)=\\begin{cases} bottom, & \\text{if } length = 0 \\\\ h(bottom, path) + length, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] Note that any arithmetic operations in the above are done in our field. We can now proceed to recursively define the nodes in the trie. The triplet representing the parent of the nodes \\(left=(\\ell_L, p_L, b_L)\\), \\(right=(\\ell_R, p_R, b_R)\\) is given by: \\[parent= \\begin{cases} (0,0,0), & \\text{if } left=right=(0,0,0)\\\\ (\\ell_L + 1, p_L, b_L), & \\text{if } right=(0,0,0) \\text{ and } left \\neq (0,0,0)\\\\ (\\ell_R + 1, p_R + 2^{\\ell_R}, b_R), & \\text{if } right\\neq (0,0,0) \\text{ and } left = (0,0,0)\\\\ (0, 0, h(H(left), H(right))), & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] Example Trie We now show an example of the construction of a height 3 Merkle-Patricia tree from the leaves \\([0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\\): Where \\(r=h(H(2,2,1),H((2,1,1))\\). Note that in our example there is no skipping from the root (length is zero), so the final commitment to the tree will be \\(H((0,0,r))=r\\). Suppose that we want to prove, with respect to the commitment we have just computed, that the value of the leaf whose path is given by \\(101\\) is \\(1\\). In a standard Merkle tree, the proof would have consisted of data from three nodes (siblings along the path to the root). Here, since the tree is sparse, we only need to send the two children of the root \\((2,2,1), (2,1,1)\\). This suffices to reproduce the commitment \\(r\\), and since the height of the tree, \\(3\\), is known and fixed, we know that the path \\(01\\) of length \\(2\\) specified by the right child \\((2,1,1)\\) leads us to the desired leaf.","title":"Starknet State","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"starknet-state","url":"/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/State/starknet-state/","titles":[{"text":"State Commitment","hash":"state_commitment","id":1},{"text":"The contracts tree","hash":"contracts_tree","id":2},{"text":"The classes tree","hash":"classes_tree","id":3},{"text":"Merkle-Patricia tree","hash":"merkle_patricia_tree","id":4},{"text":"Specifications","hash":"specifications","id":5}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"An asterisk (*) denotes required arguments. To enter a starknet command, use the following syntax: $ starknet Where: represents a single command that executes an operation on Starknet. represents zero or more command line options, each of which modifies the operation of the command. You need to set your Starknet network environment to use either testnet or Mainnet. You can set the environment using either a command-line option or an environment variable. Possible values are: alpha-goerli Sets the Starknet network to testnet alpha-mainnet Sets the Starknet network to Mainnet Setting the network environment using a command-line option When you enter any command, include the --network option. For example to use Mainnet, enter a command as follows: $ starknet --network alpha-mainnet You can place the --network option before or after any other option. Setting the network environment using an environment variable Set the STARKNET_NETWORK environment variable as follows: $ export STARKNET_NETWORK= For example, to use testnet, enter the following command: $ export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli When working with the CLI, you can manually set the endpoints for the gateways that enable you to interact with Starknet, by including the following options: --feeder_gateway_url Sets the custom endpoint for read commands. --gateway_url Sets the custom endpoint for write commands. The following are the endpoints for Starknet testnet and Mainnet: Testnet feeder gateway URL: https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/ Mainnet feeder gateway URL: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/ Testnet gateway URL: https://alpha4.starknet.io/gateway/ Mainnet gateway URL: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/gateway/ Example: Setting a custom read endpoint The following command returns the ABI using the Mainnet feeder gateway. $ starknet get_code --feeder_gateway_url https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/ Example: Setting a custom write endpoint The following command sends a transaction to the Starknet sequencer using the Mainnet gateway. $ starknet invoke --gateway_url https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/gateway/ starknet call --address --abi --function --inputs --block_hash --block_number --signature --wallet --nonce Calls a Starknet contract without affecting the state, accepts the following arguments: contract_address* - address of the contract being called contract_abi* - a path to a JSON file that contains the abi of the contract being called function_name* - name of the function which is called arguments* - inputs to the function being called, represented by a list of space-delimited values block_hash - the hash of the block used as the context for the call operation.
