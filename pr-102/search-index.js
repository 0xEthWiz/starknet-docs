Transaction is not yet known to the sequencer Transaction was received by the sequencer. Transaction will now either execute successfully or be rejected. Transaction executed successfully and entered the pending block. Transaction executed unsuccessfully and thus was skipped (applies both to a pending and an actual created block). Possible reasons for transaction rejection: An assertion failed during the execution of the transaction (in StarkNet, unlike in Ethereum, transaction executions do not always succeed). The block may be rejected on L1, thus changing the transaction status to REJECTED Transaction passed validation and entered an actual created block on L2. Transaction was accepted on-chain. Today, StarkNet supports querying the new block before its construction is complete. This feature improves the responsiveness of the system prior to the decentralization phase, but will probably become obsolete once the system is decentralized, as full nodes will only propagate finalized blocks through the network. During the construction of the block, as it is accumulating new transactions, the block’s status is PENDING. While status is PENDING, new transactions are dynamically added to the block. Once the sequencer decides to close the block, it becomes ACCEPTED_ON_L2 and its hash is computed. The following example is a query for the pending mainnet block: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/get_block?blockNumber=pending See the CLI section on how to call the gateway with respect to the pending block. The transaction receipt contains basic transaction details (block identifiers and the index within the block), a summary of the execution resources used by the transaction, the events emitted, a list of messages sent to L1, and a consumed L1 message (in case the transaction invokes an L1 handler).

StarkNet supports the transaction versions described here. When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases. Do not submit a transaction that uses an unsupported transaction type, because it cannot be included in a proof, and so cannot become part of a StarkNet block. The deploy transaction is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of StarkNet. To deploy new contract instances, you can use the deploy syscall. For more information, see contract classes. A deploy transaction is a transaction type used to deploy contracts to StarkNet. A deploy transaction has the following fields: Name Type Description contract_address_salt FieldElement A random number used to distinguish between different instances of the contract. contract_definition ContractClass The object that defines the contract’s functionality. constructor_calldata List The arguments passed to the constructor during deployment. caller_address FieldElement Who invoked the deployment. Set to 0 (in future: the deploying account contract). version FieldElement The transaction’s version. Possible values are 1 or 0. When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases. Transaction version 0 is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of StarkNet. In order to calculate the transaction hash, we first need to obtain the deployed contract address. The Deploy transaction’s hash is calculated as follows: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{deploy_tx_hash} = h( & ``\\text{deploy\"}, \\text{version}, \\text{ contract_address}, \\text{sn_keccak}(``\\text{constructor\"}), \\\\ & h(\\text{constructor_calldata}), 0, \\text{chain_id}) \\end{aligned}\\] Where: The placeholder zero is used to align the hash computation for the different types of transactions. “deploy” and “constructor” are constant strings encoded in ASCII. \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash and \\(sn\\_keccak\\) is StarkNet Keccak chain_id is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent. See Chain-Id. contract_address is calculated as described here. The invoke transaction is the main transaction type used to invoke contract functions in StarkNet. Transaction version 0 is deprecated and will be removed in a future release of StarkNet. Table 1. Transaction fields Name Type Description sender_address FieldElement The address of the sender of this transaction. calldata List The arguments that are passed to the validate and execute functions. signature List Additional information given by the sender, used to validate the transaction. max_fee FieldElement The maximum fee that the sender is willing to pay for the transaction nonce FieldElement The transaction nonce. version FieldElement The transaction’s version. The value is 1. When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases. Table 2. Transaction fields Name Type Description contract_address FieldElement The address of the contract invoked by this transaction. entry_point_selector FieldElement The encoding of the selector for the function invoked (the entry point in the contract) calldata List The arguments that are passed to the invoked function signature List Additional information given by the sender, used to validate the transaction. max_fee FieldElement The maximum fee that the sender is willing to pay for the transaction version FieldElement The transaction’s version. The value is 0. Transaction version 0 is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of StarkNet. When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases.

See Chain-Id. \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash The declare transaction is used to introduce new classes into the state of StarkNet, enabling other contracts to deploy instances of those classes or using them in a library call. For more information, see contract classes. A declare transaction has the following fields: Name Type Description contract_class ContractClass The class object. sender_address FieldElement The address of the account initiating the transaction. max_fee FieldElement The maximum fee that the sender is willing to pay for the transaction. signature List Additional information given by the sender, used to validate the transaction. nonce FieldElement The transaction nonce. version FieldElement The transaction’s version. Possible values are 1 or 0. When the fields that comprise a transaction change, either with the addition of a new field or the removal of an existing field, then the transaction version increases.

To enter a starknet command, use the following syntax: $ starknet Where: represents a single command that executes an operation on StarkNet. represents zero or more command line options, each of which modifies the operation of the command. You need to set your StarkNet network environment to use either testnet or Mainnet. You can set the environment using either a command-line option or an environment variable. Possible values are: alpha-goerli Sets the StarkNet network to testnet alpha-mainnet Sets the StarkNet network to Mainnet Setting the network environment using a command-line option When you enter any command, include the --network option. For example to use Mainnet, enter a command as follows: $ starknet --network alpha-mainnet You can place the --network option before or after any other option. Setting the network environment using an environment variable Set the STARKNET_NETWORK environment variable as follows: $ export STARKNET_NETWORK= For example, to use testnet, enter the following command: $ export STARKNET_NETWORK=alpha-goerli When working with the CLI, you can manually set the endpoints for the gateways that enable you to interact with StarkNet, by including the following options: --feeder_gateway_url Sets the custom endpoint for read commands. --gateway_url Sets the custom endpoint for write commands. The following are the endpoints for StarkNet testnet and Mainnet: Testnet feeder gateway URL: https://alpha4.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/ Mainnet feeder gateway URL: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/ Testnet gateway URL: https://alpha4.starknet.io/gateway/ Mainnet gateway URL: https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/gateway/ Example: Setting a custom read endpoint The following command returns the ABI using the Mainnet feeder gateway. $ starknet get_code --feeder_gateway_url https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/feeder_gateway/ Example: Setting a custom write endpoint The following command sends a transaction to the StarkNet sequencer using the Mainnet gateway. $ starknet invoke --gateway_url https://alpha-mainnet.starknet.io/gateway/ starknet deploy_account --wallet --account Deploys an account contract, accepts the following arguments: account_name - the name given to the account, used for managing multiple accounts from the CLI (if not specified, the name __default__ is used. wallet_provider* - the path to module which manages the account (responsible for key generation, signing, etc.) Today, the StarkNet CLI only works with the OpenZeppelin account contract. The CLI uses this specific wallet provider. To use this provider, either set up the following environment variable or pass the same value directly to the wallet_provider parameter: $ export STARKNET_WALLET=starkware.starknet.wallets.open_zeppelin.OpenZeppelinAccount Using the builtin wallet providers that are part of the cairo-lang package (starkware.starknet.wallets…​) is not secure (for example, the private key may be kept not encrypted and without backup in your home directory). You should only use them if you’re not overly concerned with losing access to your accounts (for example, for testing purposes). starknet invoke --address --abi --function --inputs --signature --wallet --nonce Sends a transaction to the StarkNet sequencer, accepts the following arguments: address* - the address of the contract being called contract_abi* - a path to a JSON file that contains the abi of the contract being called function_name*- the name of the function being called arguments* - inputs to the function being called, represented by a list of space-delimited values signature_information - list of field elements as described here wallet_name - the name of the desired wallet, use deploy_account to set-up new accounts in the CLI. nonce - account nonce, only relevant if the call is going through an account Today, interaction with StarkNet may be done either via account or by a direct call. The signature argument can only be provided in the case of a direct call, since otherwise providing the signature is the responsibility of the account module. To use an account you must specify wallet_name, otherwise a direct call will be used (you may also explicitly perform a direct call by adding --no_wallet to the command). Note that in the future direct calls will be deprecated and the only way to interact with the system would be through accounts. starknet deploy --salt --contract --inputs --token Deploys a new contract, accepts the following arguments: salt - a seed that is used in the computation of the contract’s address (if not specified, the sequencer will choose a random string) contract_definition* - path to a JSON file containing the contract’s bytecode and abi (can be obtained by executing starknet-compile) constructor_inputs* - the arguments given to the contract’s constructor, represented by a list of space-delimited values token - a token allowing contract deployment (can be obtained by applying here).

Notice that only contract instances behave as contracts in that they have their own storage and can be called by transactions or other contracts. A contract class does not necessarily have a deployed instance in StarkNet. New classes can be added to the state of StarkNet with the declare transaction. New instances of a previously declared class can be deployed via the deploy system call. To use the functionality of a declared class, without deploying an instance of that class, you can use the library_call system call.

This function returns the address of the storage variable. Below we discuss how this address is determined from the variable’s name and keys. The most common way for interacting with a contract’s storage is through storage variables. The @storage_var decorator declares a variable that will be kept as part of the contract storage. The variable can consist of a single felt, or it can be a mapping from multiple arguments to a tuple of felts or structs. To use this variable, the var.read(args), var.write(args, value) and var.addr(args) functions are automatically created by the @storage_var decorator, for reading the storage value, writing the storage value and getting the storage address, respectively. The StarkNet contract compiler generates the Cairo code that maps the storage variable’s name and argument values to an address — so that it can be part of the generated proof. The address of a storage variable is computed as follows: If it is a single value, then the address is sn_keccak(variable_name), where variable_name is the ASCII encoding of the variable’s name. If it is a (nested) mapping, then the address of the value at key k_1,...,k_n is h(...h(h(sn_keccak(variable_name),k_1),k_2),...,k_n) where \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash and the final value is taken \\(\\bmod (2^{251-256})\\) If it is a mapping to complex values (e.g., tuples or structs), then this complex value lies in a continuous segment starting from the address calculated in the previous point. Note that 256 field elements is the current limitation on the maximal size of a complex storage value. Note that when calling var.addr(args) for a storage variable with complex values, the returned value is the address of the first element in the storage. Roughly, we can summarize the above as follows: storage variable address := pedersen(keccak(variable name), keys) In the following example we define a storage variable named range that is a mapping from a key to a Tuple of two values. @storage_var func range(user : felt) -> (res : (felt, felt)): end","title":"Contract Storage","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"contract-storage","url":"/documentation/develop/Contracts/contract-storage/","titles":[{"text":"Storage Layout","hash":"storage_layout","id":1},{"text":"Storage Low Level Functions","hash":"storage_low_level_functions","id":2},{"text":"Storage Variables","hash":"storage_variables","id":3}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"In the current stage of the Alpha, StarkNet operates in a ZK-Rollup mode.

Each event contains the following fields: from_address: address of the contract emitting the events keys: a list of field elements data: a list of field elements The keys can be used for indexing the events, while the data may contain any information that we wish to log (note that we are dealing with two separate lists of possibly varying size, rather than a list of key-value pairs). Events can be defined in a contract using the @event decorator. Once an event E has been defined, the compiler automatically adds the function E.emit(). The following example illustrates how an event is defined and emitted: @event func message_received(a : felt, b: felt): end message_received.emit(1, 2); The emit function emits an event with a single key, which is an identifier of the event, given by \\(\\text{sn_keccak(event_name)}\\), where \\(\\text{event_name}\\) is the ASCII encoding of the event’s name and \\(\\text{sn_keccak}\\) is defined here. To emit custom keys, one should use the low level emit_event system call: from starkware.starknet.common.syscalls import emit_event # ... let (keys : felt*) = alloc() assert keys[0] = 'status' assert keys[1] = 'deposit' let (data : felt*) = alloc() assert data[0] = 1 assert data[1] = 2 assert data[2] = 3 emit_event(2, keys, 3, data) The above code emits an event with two keys, the strings \"status\" and \"deposit\" (think of those as identifiers of the event that can be used for indexing) and three data elments 1, 2, 3. When using the higher level emit syntax, the event’s data may be of complex types, for example: struct Point: member x : felt member y : felt end @event func message_received(arr_len : felt, arr: felt*, p: Point): end # ... let (data : felt*) = alloc() assert data[0] = 1 assert data[1] = 2 let p = Point(3,4) message_received.emit(2, data, p) The emitted events are part of the transaction receipt. The event definition appears in the contract’s ABI.

If you want to skip the motivation and deep dive into the mechanism, you can skip directly to the final formula. This section focuses on fees paid by an account on L2. For information about messaging fees that are paid on L1, see L1 → L2 message fees. Users can specify the maximum fee that they are willing to pay for a transaction via the max_fee field. The only limitation on the sequencer (enforced by the StarkNet OS) is that the actual fee charged is bounded by max_fee, but for now, StarkWare’s sequencer will only charge the fee required to cover the proof cost (potentially less than the max fee). Presently, the sequencer only takes into account L1 costs involving proof submission. There are two components affecting the L1 footprint of a transaction: computational complexity: the heavier the transaction, the larger its portion in the proof verification cost. on chain data: L1 calldata cost originating from data availability and L2→L1 messages. The fee is denominated in ETH (this may change in future versions). Each transaction is associated with a gas estimate (explained below), and combining this with the gas price yields the estimated fee. Let’s analyze the correct metric for measuring transaction complexity. For simplicity, we will ignore Cairo’s builtins for the sake of the explanation, then see later how to refer to them. Recall that a Cairo program execution yields an execution trace. When proving a StarkNet block, we aggregate all the transactions appearing in that block to the execution trace. StarkNet’s prover generates proofs for execution traces, up to some maximal length \\(L\\) (Derived from the specs of the proving machine and the desired proof latency). Tracking the execution trace length associated with each transaction is simple. Each assertion over field elements (such as verifying addition/multiplication over the field) requires the same, constant number of trace cells (this is where our “no-builtins” assumption kicks in! Obviously Pedersen occupies more trace cells than addition). Therefore, in a world without builtins, the fee of the transaction is correlated with \\(\\text{TraceCells}[tx]/L\\). The Cairo execution trace is separated — and each builtin has its own slot. We have to mind this slot allocation when determining the fee. Let’s go over a concrete example first. For example, imagine the following trace that the prover will occupy: (up to) 500,000,000 Cairo Steps (up to) 20,000,000 Pedersen hashes (up to) 4,000,000 signature verifications (up to) 10,000,000 range checks The proof will be closed and sent to L1 when any of these components becomes full. It’s important to realize that the division to builtins must be predetermined! We can’t decide on the fly to have proof with 20,000,001 Pedersen and nothing else. Suppose, for example, that a transaction uses 10,000 Cairo steps and 500 Pedersen hashes. We can squeeze at most 40,000 such transactions into our hypothetical trace (20,000,000/500). Therefore, its gas price will be correlated with 1/40,000 the cost of submitting proof. Notice we completely ignored the number of Cairo steps this transaction performance estimation, as it is not the limiting factor (since 500,000,000/10,000 > 20,000,000/500). With this example in mind, we can now formulate the exact fee associated with L2 computation. For each transaction, the sequencer calculates a vector CairoResourceUsage holding: Number of Cairo steps Number of applications of each Cairo builtin (e.g., five range checks and two Pedersens) The sequencer crosses this information with the CairoResourceFeeWeights vector. For each resource type (step or a specific builtin application), CairoResourceFeeWeights has an entry that specifies the relative gas cost of that component in the proof. Going back to the above example, if the cost of submitting a proof with 20,000,000 Pedersen hashes is roughly 5m gas, then the weight of the Pedersen builtin is 0.25 gas per application (5,000,000/20,000,000). The sequencer has a pre-defined weights vector, in accordance with the proof parameters. The sequencer will charge only according to the limiting factor! Therefore the fee is correlated with: \\[\\max_k[\\text{CairoResourceUsage}_k \\cdot \\text{CairoResourceFeeWeights}_k]\\] Where \\(k\\) here enumerates the Cairo resource components, namely: number of steps and built-ins used. The weights are: Cairo step ECDSA range check bitwise Pedersen 0.05 gas/step 25.6 gas/application 0.4 gas/application 12.8 gas/application 0.4 gas/application The on-chain data associated with a transaction is composed of three parts storage updates l2→l1 messages deployed contracts Whenever a transaction updates a key at the storage of some contract, the following 32 byte words reach L1 as calldata: contract_address number of updated keys in that contract key to update new value Note that only the most recent value reaches L1. That is, the transaction’s fee only depends on the number of unique storage updates (if the same storage cell is updated multiple times within the transaction, the fee remains that of a single update). For more information, see the exact format. Let \\(c_w\\) denote the L1 calldata cost of a 32 byte word, measured in gas. With 16 gas per byte we have \\(c_w=16\\cdot 32=512\\). Consequently, the associated storage update fee for a transaction updating \\(n\\) unique contracts and \\(m\\) unique keys is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot c_w\\cdot\\underbrace{(2n+2m)}_{\\text{number of words}}\\] Note that there are many possible improvements to the above pessimistic estimation that will be gradually presented in future versions of StarkNet. For example, if different transactions within the same block update the same storage cell, there is no need to charge both of them (only the latest value reaches L1). In the future, StarkNet may include a refund mechanism for such cases. When a transaction which raises the send_message_to_l1 syscall is included in a state update, the following data reaches L1: l2 sender address l1 destination address payload size payload (list of field elements) Consequently, the fee associated with a single l2→l1 message is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot c_w\\cdot(3+\\text{payload_size})\\] When a transactions which raises the deploy syscall is included in a state update, the following data reaches L1: contract addresss class hash number of constructor arguments constructor arguments Consequently, the fee associated with a single deployment is: \\[\\text{gas_price}\\cdot c_w\\cdot(3+\\text{# of constructor arguments})\\] The fee for a transaction with: Cairo usage represented by the vector \\(v\\) (the entries of \\(v\\) correspond to the number of steps and number of applications per builtin) \\(n\\) unique contract updates \\(m\\) unique key updates \\(t\\) messages with payload sizes \\(q_1,...,q_t\\) \\(\\ell\\) deployments with number of constructor arguments \\(c_1,...,c_\\ell\\) is given by: \\[F = \\text{gas_price}\\cdot\\left(\\max_k v_k w_k + c_w\\left(2(n+m) + 3t + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^t q_i + 3\\ell + \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^\\ell c_i\\right)\\right)\\] where \\(w\\) is the weights vector discussed above and \\(c_w\\) is the calldata cost (in gas) per 32 byte word. The fee is charged atomically with the transaction execution on L2. The StarkNet OS injects a transfer of the fee-related ERC-20, with an amount equal to the fee paid, sender equals to the transaction submitter, and the sequencer as a receiver.","title":"Fee Mechanism","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"fee-mechanism","url":"/documentation/develop/Fees/fee-mechanism/","titles":[{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":1},{"text":"Fee Units","hash":"fee_units","id":2},{"text":"How much fee is charged?

During the execution of a StarkNet transaction, a contract on StarkNet sends an L2→L1 message by calling the send_message_to_L1 syscall. The message parameters (which contain the recipient contract on L1 and the relevant data) are then attached to the relevant state update that includes this syscall invocation. For example: let (message_payload : felt*) = alloc() assert message_payload[0] = // potentially add more elements to message_payload (message_payload[1], message_payload[2], etc.) assert_lt_felt(to_address, ETH_ADDRESS_BOUND) assert_not_zero(to_address) send_message_to_l1(to_address=to_address, payload_size=1, payload=message_payload) After the state update that included this transaction is proved and the L1 state is updated, the hash of the message is stored on L1 in the StarkNet Core Contract (and the relevant counter is increased), and the LogMessageToL1 event (which contains the message parameters) is emitted. Later, the recipient address on L1 can access and consume the message as part of an L1 transaction by re-supplying the message parameters. This is done by calling consumeMessageFromL2 in the StarkNet Core Contract, who verifies that the hash corresponds to a stored message and that the caller is indeed the recipient on L1. In such a case, the reference count of the message hash in the StarkNet Core Contract decreases by 1. The above flow is illustrated in the following diagram: As demonstrated above, the structure of an L2 → L1 message is given by: Table 1. L2 → L1 Message FromAddress ToAddress Payload FieldElement EthereumAddress Payload The hash of an L2 → L1 message is computed on L1 as follows: keccak256( abi.encodePacked( FromAddress, ToAddress, Payload.length, Payload ) ); Contracts on L1 can interact asynchronously with contracts on L2 via the L1→L2 messaging protocol. The protocol consists of the following stages: 1. An L1 contract initiates a message to an L2 contract on StarkNet. It does so by calling the sendMessageToL2 function on the StarkNet Core Contract with the message parameters. 1.1 The StarkNet Core Contract hashes the message parameters and updates the L1→L2 message mapping to indicate that a message with this hash was indeed sent. In fact, the L1 contract records the fee that the sender paid. For more information, see L1 → L2 message fees. 2. The message is then decoded into a StarkNet transaction that invokes a function annotated with the l1_handler decorator on the target contract. Transactions like this on L2 are called L1 handler transactions. 2.1. The StarkNet sequencer, upon seeing enough L1 confirmations for the transaction that sent the message, initiates the corresponding L2 transaction. 2.2. The L2 transaction invokes the relevant l1_handler. 3. The L1 Handler transaction that was created in the previous step is added to a proof. 4. The state update is received on the Core contract 5. the message is cleared from the Core contract’s storage. At this point the message is handled. The above flow is illustrated in the following diagram: An L1→L2 message consists of: The L1 sender address The recipient contract address on StarkNet Function selector Calldata array Message nonce Message nonce The message nonce is maintained on the StarkNet Core contract on L1, and is bumped whenever a message is sent to L2. It is used to avoid hash collisions between different L1 handler transactions who are induced by the same message being sent on L1 multiple times (see below). Imagine a scenario where a user transfers an asset from L1 to L2. The flow starts with the user sending the asset to a StarkNet bridge and the corresponding L1→L2 message generation. Now, imagine that the L2 message consumption doesn’t function (this might happen due to a bug in the dApps’s Cairo contract). This could result in the user losing custody over their asset forever. To mitigate this risk, we allow the contract that initiated the L1→L2 message to cancel it — after declaring the intent and waiting a suitable amount of time. The user starts by calling startL1ToL2MessageCancellation with the relevant message parameters in the StarkNet Core Contract. Then, after a five days delay, the user can finalize the cancellation by calling cancelL1ToL2Message. The reason for the delay is to protect the sequencer from a DOS attack in the form of repeatedly sending and canceling a message — before it is included in L1, rendering the L2 block which contains the activation of the corresponding L1 handler invalid. Note that this flow should only be used in edge cases such as bugs on the Layer 2 contract preventing message consumption. An L1 → L2 message induces a transaction on L2, which, unlike regular transactions, is not sent by an account. This calls for a different mechanism for paying the transaction’s fee, for otherwise the sequencer has no incentive of including L1 handler transactions inside a block. To avoid having to interact with both L1 and L2 when sending a message, L1 → L2 messages are payable on L1, by sending ETH with the call to the payable function sendMessageToL2 on the StarkNet Core contract. The sequencer takes this fee in exchange for handling the message. The sequencer charges the fee in full upon updating the L1 state with the consumption of this message. Throughout the lifecycle of the message, the associated fee is locked in the Core contract. If the message was not processed for any reason, then cancelling the message will also return the fee to the sender. The fee itself is calculated in the same manner as \"regular\" L2 transactions. You can use the CLI to get an estimate of an L1 → L2 message fee. For completeness, we describe the precise structure of both the message as it appears on L1 and the induced transaction as it appears on L2. Table 2. L1 → L2 Message FromAddress ToAddress Selector Payload Nonce EthereumAddress FieldElement FieldElement List FieldElement Version ContractAddress Selector Calldata Nonce FieldElement FieldElement List FieldElement FieldElement The hash of the message is computed on L1 as follows: keccak256( abi.encodePacked( uint256(FromAddress), ToAddress, Nonce, Selector, Payload.length, Payload ) ); The hash of the corresponding L1 handler transaction on L2 is computed as follows: \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{l1_handler_tx_hash} = h( & \\text{\"l1_handler\"}, \\text{ version}, \\text{ contract_address}, \\text{ entry_point_selector}, \\\\ & h(\\text{ calldata}), \\text{ max_fee}, \\text{ chain_id}, \\text{ nonce}) \\end{aligned}\\] Where: \\(\\text{l1_handler}\\) is a constant prefix, encoded in bytes (ASCII), with big-endian. \\(\\text{chain_id}\\) is a constant value that specifies the network to which this transaction is sent.

Each supported token is associated with an L1 and L2 bridge contracts that are communicating via StarkNet’s messaging mechanism. The bridges facilitate a user’s ability to conduct their transactions with their ETH and ERC-20 tokens that reside on L1, via the StarkNet Alpha network and its STARK-based computational compression capabilities. For simplicity, we use terms such as “deposit”, “transact”, and “transfer” to refer to various operations involving a bridge, even though ETH and ERC20 tokens never actually leave Ethereum. The user calls the function deposit (see ERC-20 deposit and ETH deposit), supplying as parameters the recipient address on StarkNet and the amount to transfer in the case of ERC-20 token. The deposit function then: Checks that the funds transferred are within the Alpha limitations Transfers the funds from the user account to the StarkNet bridge Emits a deposit event with the sender address on L1, the recipient address on L2, and the amount Sends a message to the relevant L2 bridge with the amount to be transferred, and the recipient address as parameters. Note that, since every single bridge is dedicated to one token type, the token type doesn’t have to be explicit here. At the end of this step (i.e., after the execution on L1) the deposit transaction is known to StarkNet’s sequencer, yet sequencers may wait for enough L1 confirmations before corresponding deposit transaction is initated on L2. During this step, the status of the L2 deposit transaction is NOT_RECEIVED. Once enough block confirmations are received for step 1, the sequencers may refer to the deposit request by triggering the L1 handler \"` handle_deposit on the L2 bridge. The function handle_deposit verifies that the deposit indeed came from the corresponding L1 bridge. It then calls to the relevant ERC-20 contract (e.g. the ERC-20 representing ETH on StarkNet) and mints the tokens for the user. At the end of this step (i.e., after the sequencer processed this transaction, but before a proof is generated), the status of the deposit request will be ACCEPTED_ON_L2. Once the sequencer completes the block construction, StarkNet’s provers will prove its validity and submit a state update to L1. When this happens, the message confirming the funds transfer will be cleared from the StarkNet Core Contract, and the fact that the user has transferred their funds will be part of the now finalized state of StarkNet. Note that if the message wasn’t on L1 to begin with (meaning StarkNet “invented” a deposit request), the state update would fail. To initiate a withdraw, a user calls the initiate_withdraw function on the L2 bridge contract, supplying as parameters the recipient address on Ethereum, as well as the amount to transfer. The withdraw function then: Burns the transferred amount of tokens from the balance of the withdrawal’s initiator Sends a message to the relevant L1 bridge with the amount to be transferred, and the recipient address as parameters. As before, since the bridges are token-specific, the token itself is implicit here. Once the sequencer completes the block construction, StarkNet’s provers will prove the validity of the block and submit a state update to L1. When this happens, the message from the previous step is stored in the StarkNet Core Contract. After the withdraw message has been recorded on the StarkNet Core Contract, anyone can finalize the transfer on L1 from the bridge back to the user, by calling the withdraw function (see ERC-20 withdraw and ETH withdraw). This step is permissionless, and may be performed by anyone. Since the user’s address is part of the recorded message on L1, he will be the recepient of the funds, regardless of who called the withdraw function on L1. In order to reduce the risks involved in using an Alpha version, StarkGate Alpha on Mainnet has limitations involving the deposit amount and total value locked in the L1 bridge contract: Token Max deposit Max total value locked ETH 0.25 Eth 450 Eth DAI 50 Dai 100,000 Dai USDC 100 USDC 100,000 USDC USDT 100 USDT 100,000 USDT WBTC 0.005 WBTC 5 WBTC We plan to gradually ease these limitations and lift them completely, as confidence grows.

When a transaction is sent to a given contract, the transaction’s nonce must match the nonce of the contract. After the transaction is executed, the contract’s nonce is increased by one. Note that while on Ethereum, only EOAs can send transactions and consequently have a non-zero nonce, on StarkNet, only account contracts can send transactions and have a non-zero nonce. With the above definition, we can provide a brief sketch of StarkNet’s transition function. A transaction \\(tx\\) transitions the system from state \\(S\\) to state \\(S'\\) if: \\(tx\\) is an invoke transaction, and the storage of \\(S'\\) is the result of executing the target contract code with respect to the previous state \\(S\\) (the arguments, contract address, and the specific entry point are part of the transaction) \\(tx\\) is a deploy transaction, and \\(S'\\) contains the new contract’s state at the contract’s address. Additionally, the storage of \\(S\\) is updated according to the execution of the contract’s constructor. \\(tx\\) is a declare transaction, and \\(S'\\) contains the class hash and definition in the contract classes mapping The state commitment is a digest which uniquely (up to hash collisions) encodes the state. In StarkNet, the commitment is the root of a binary Merkle-Patricia tree of height 251. Like Ethereum, this is a 2-level structure where the contract address determines the path from the root to the leaf encoding the contract state. The information stored in the leaf is: \\[h(h(h(\\text{class_hash}, \\text{storage_root}), 0),0)\\] Where: \\(\\text{class_hash}\\) is the hash of the contract’s definition discussed here \\(\\text{storage_root}\\) is the root of another Merkle-Patricia tree of height 251 that is constructed from the contract’s storage \\(h\\) is the Pedersen hash function. The commitment does not include class information. This will be added in future versions. As mentioned above, our commitment scheme uses a binary Merkle-Patricia tree with the Pedersen hash function. Each node in the tree is represented by a triplet \\((length, path, bottom)\\). The actual data is placed in the leaves, and a leaf node with data \\(x\\) is encoded by the triplet \\((0,0,x)\\). Empty nodes (leaves or internal) are encoded by the zero triplet \\((0,0,0)\\). A subtree rooted at a node \\((length, path, bottom)\\) has a single non-empty subtree, rooted at the node obtained by following the path specified by \\(path\\). \\(path\\) is an integer in \\([0, 2^{length}-1]\\), and the binary expansion of \\(path\\) indicates how should we proceed along the tree, where the first step is indicated by the most significant bit, and \\(0,1\\) are interpreted as left, right correspondingly. Note that the reason that length is specified and cannot be deduced from \\(path\\) is that we’re dealing with field elements of fixed size (251 bits each). For a node with \\(length>0\\), following \\(path\\) leads the highest node whose both right and left child are none empty. The following rules specify how the tree is constructed from a given set of leaves: The hash of a node \\(N =(length, path, bottom)\\), denoted by \\(H(N)\\), is: \\[H(N)=\\begin{cases} bottom, & \\text{if } length = 0 \\\\ h(bottom, path) + length, & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] Note that any arithmetic operations in the above are done in our field. We can now proceed to recursively define the nodes in the trie. The triplet representing the parent of the nodes \\(left=(\\ell_L, p_L, b_L)\\), \\(right=(\\ell_R, p_R, b_R)\\) is given by: \\[parent= \\begin{cases} (0,0,0), & \\text{if } left=right=(0,0,0)\\\\ (\\ell_L + 1, p_L, b_L), & \\text{if } right=(0,0,0) \\text{ and } left \\neq (0,0,0)\\\\ (\\ell_R + 1, p_R + 2^{\\ell_R}, b_R), & \\text{if } right\\neq (0,0,0) \\text{ and } left = (0,0,0)\\\\ (0, 0, h(H(left), H(right))), & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\\] Example Trie We now show an example of the construction of a height 3 Merkle-Patricia tree from the leaves \\([0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0]\\): Where \\(r=h(H(2,2,1),H((2,1,1))\\). Note that in our example there is no skipping from the root (length is zero), so the final commitment to the tree will be \\(H((0,0,r))=r\\). Suppose that we want to prove, with respect to the commitment we have just computed, that the value of the leaf whose path is given by \\(101\\) is \\(1\\). In a standard Merkle tree, the proof would have consisted of data from three nodes (siblings along the path to the root). Here, since the tree is sparse, we only need to send the two children of the root \\((2,2,1), (2,1,1)\\). This suffices to reproduce the commitment \\(r\\), and since the height of the tree, \\(3\\), is known and fixed, we know that the path \\(01\\) of length \\(2\\) specified by the right child \\((2,1,1)\\) leads us to the desired leaf.","title":"StarkNet State","component":"documentation","version":"","name":"starknet-state","url":"/documentation/develop/State/starknet-state/","titles":[{"text":"State Commitment","hash":"state_commitment","id":1},{"text":"Merkle-Patricia tree","hash":"merkle_patricia_tree","id":2},{"text":"Specifications","hash":"specifications","id":3}]}},"components":{},"componentVersions":{"documentation/":{"displayVersion":"default","title":"StarkNet","version":"","name":"documentation","asciidoc":{"attributes":{"env":"site","env-site":"","site-gen":"antora","site-gen-antora":"","attribute-missing":"warn","data-uri":null,"icons":"font","sectanchors":"","source-highlighter":"highlight.js","site-title":"StarkNet documentation","site-url":"https://docs.starknet.io/","idprefix":"","stem":"latexmath","page-pagination":"","experimental":""},"sourcemap":false},"url":"/documentation/","navigation":[{"items":[{"content":"What Is StarkNet","url":"/documentation/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"StarkNet block explorers","url":"/documentation/Ecosystem/ref_block_explorers/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Operational info","url":"/documentation/Ecosystem/ref_operational_info/","urlType":"internal"}],"root":true,"order":0},{"items":[{"content":"Developing on StarkNet","items":[{"content":"Blocks and transactions","items":[{"content":"Block structure","url":"/documentation/develop/Blocks/header/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Transaction lifecycle","url":"/documentation/develop/Blocks/transaction-life-cycle/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Transaction structure","url":"/documentation/develop/Blocks/transactions/","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Hashing","items":[{"content":"Hash functions","url":"/documentation/develop/Hashing/hash-functions/","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Contracts","items":[{"content":"Contract ABI","url":"/documentation/develop/Contracts/contract-abi/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Contract address","url":"/documentation/develop/Contracts/contract-address/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Contract classes","url":"/documentation/develop/Contracts/contract-classes/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Class hash","url":"/documentation/develop/Contracts/contract-hash/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"Contract storage","url":"/documentation/develop/Contracts/contract-storage/","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Data Availability","items":[{"content":"On-chain data","url":"/documentation/develop/Data_Availability/on-chain-data/","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Events","items":[{"content":"StarkNet events","url":"/documentation/develop/Events/starknet-events/","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"Fees","items":[{"content":"Fee mechanism","url":"/documentation/develop/Fees/fee-mechanism/","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"L1-L2 Communication","items":[{"content":"Messaging mechanism","url":"/documentation/develop/L1-L2_Communication/messaging-mechanism/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"StarkGate – Token Bridge","url":"/documentation/develop/L1-L2_Communication/token-bridge/","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"State","items":[{"content":"StarkNet state","url":"/documentation/develop/State/starknet-state/","urlType":"internal"}]},{"content":"StarkNet CLI reference","url":"/documentation/develop/CLI/commands/","urlType":"internal"},{"content":"StarkNet compiler reference","url":"/documentation/develop/CLI/starknet-compiler-options/","urlType":"internal"}]}],"root":true,"order":1}]}}}})
